Recent advances in acoustic sensors provide a novel way to monitor animals through investigating collected bioacoustic recordings. To accurately monitor animals, the precondition is the high performance of developed bioacoustic signal recognition model. However, since bioacoustic recordings are often obtained in an open environment, various sources of noise will affect the audio quality, which causes problems for automated analysis of animal sound recordings. Although various methods have been developed for addressing the noise in different bioacoustic recordings, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no paper that reviews and summarizes those methods. The main aim of this paper is to provide a systematic survey of the existing literature related to bioacoustic signal denoising. By investigating the existing denoising methods for bioacoustic recordings, current challenges, possible opportunities, and future research directions are discussed and concluded.",Bioacoustic signal denoising;Bioacoustic signal enhancement;Noise reduction,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW,2021,JUN,Review,English,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence"
10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113390,Bioacoustic signal classification in continuous recordings: Syllable-segmentation vs sliding-window,"Xie,Jie;Hu,Kai;Zhu,Mingying;Guo,Ya",Jiangnan University;Jiangnan University;Jiangnan University;University of Ottawa,"Frog population has been experiencing rapid decreases worldwide, which is regarded as one of the most critical threats to the global biodiversity. Therefore, large volumes of frog recordings have been collected for assessing this decline. Building an automatic frog species classification system is becoming ever more important. The traditional system for classifying frog species consists of four steps: (1) bioacoustic signal preprocessing, (2) segmentation, (3) feature extraction, (4) classification. Each prior step has a direct impact on the subsequent step. Consequently, the final classification performance is highly affected by the initial three steps. However, the performance of bioacoustic signal segmentation is highly dependent on the background noise of those environmental recordings. In this study, we propose an end-to-end approach for acoustic classification of frog species in continuous recordings. First, a sliding window is used to segment the audio signal into frames. Then, 1D-Convolution Neural Network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) network is used to learn a representation from the raw audio signal, where three Convolutional layers and one LSTM layer are used to capture the signal's pattern. Experimental results in classifying 23 Australian frog species demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CNN-LSTM based method. Compared to the syllable-segmentation based frog species classification system, our proposed CNN-LSTM based approach is more robust in frog species classification under various noisy conditions.

Transvalvular and venous flows are, however, markedly influenced by respiration. Since the start of inspiration is the important time of reference, accurate recording of the respiratory phase is important when analysing these flow velocities. A bioacoustic technique was therefore adopted to meet this demand and was tested in 10 normal subjects. Oesophageal balloon technique was used as a reference, and the bioacoustic technique was compared with a respiratory inductive plethysmograph. The average delay for the acoustic sensor signal compared to the oesophageal pressure changes was 205+/-46 (SD) ms, ranging from 160 to 320 ms for normal breathing, and is comparable to that of the respiratory inductive plethysmograph (210+/-90 ms). The bioacoustic technique is easier to apply than the respiratory inductive plethysmograph. The sensitivity to disturbances can be further reduced by signal processing and the method has clinical potential for the future.",DELAY TIME;BIOACOUSTIC SENSOR;INTRATHORACIC PRESSURE;ESOPHAGEAL BALLOON;RESPIRATORY INDUCTIVE PLETHYSMOGRAPH,CLINICAL PHYSIOLOGY,1995,MAR,Article,English,Physiology

However, application of ultrasound enhances the effectiveness of the antibiotic. The possible mechanisms of this phenomenon were explored in light of the observed influence of various ultrasonic parameters on the enhanced action of gentamicin against biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is postulated that ultrasound increases the transport of gentamicin through the cell membranes, which is the proposed rate determining step in killing by gentamicin. It is possible that the ultrasound perturbs the cell membrane and stimulates active uptake or permits passive uptake by temporarily disrupting the membrane or other structural cell components. The cell membrane disruption could be caused by high pressure, high shear stress, or cavitation. The dependence upon peak power density suggests that acoustic pressure plays a significant role. There is also a strong frequency component that causes the killing effect to decrease as frequency increases. A mathematical analysis of oscillatory shear stress on the cell shows that the magnitude of stress increases with frequency; thus, the hypothesis of oscillatory shear inducing antibiotic uptake is discounted. in addition, the shear displacement caused by shear forces is very small, so the shear disruption caused by oscillatory flow in an acoustic field has minimal impact. The experimental data also rule out the existence of transient cavitation in the bioacoustic effect. It is possible that stable cavitation and the accompanying microstreaming contribute to the bioacoustic effect.

In this paper results of a bioacoustic monitoring of birds in a wetland restoration area in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in Northeastern Germany are presented. Ninety minutes of sound recordings were made daily from March 29 until May 30 2012 using a four-channel recording setup. The recording schedule was mainly designed for nocturnal birds but also included dawn and dusk choruses. By listening to the recordings, supported by spectrographic visualization, 61 bird species could be detected. Despite the fact that most of the recordings were made during the night, no period of absolute silence was detected. The occurrence data allow some conclusions on the state of the bird species, e.g., breeding bird, resting during migration, or guest only. The bioacoustic monitoring revealed the occurrence of rare nocturnal birds such as Little Crake (Porzana parva), Spotted Crake (Porzana porzana) and Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus). For the Eurasian Bittern (Botaurus stellaris) data on vocal activity and population size could be obtained.

The technique uses kurtosis (zero-lag fourth-order statistics) to form an iterative kurtosis-based detector (IKD). The IKD iteratively detects important peaks of the kurtosis, estimated within a sliding window along the signal under investigation, which indicate the presence of non-Gaussianity in the raw signal. The efficiency of the IKD has been illustrated by experimental results that demonstrate its ability to clearly detect bioacoustic signals of diagnostic interest in the presence of background signal with high amplitude.

Therefore, large volumes of frog recordings have been collected for assessing this decline. Most previous studies focused on the syllable segmentation based frog call classification, which is sensitive to the background noise. Our recent study has used 1D-CNN and cross-entropy loss for frog call classification. However, the use of 1D-CNN is sensitive to the background noise and the imbalance of the number of different frog species is not considered. Therefore, this study aims to investigate loss functions and imbalance learning for bioacoustic signal classification in continuous recordings. Specifically, four types of loss functions are compared including cross-entropy loss, weighted cross-entropy loss, focal loss, and twin loss, which are combined with three CNN architectures: 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and 1D-2D-CNN. In addition, random oversampling is used for improving the classification performance of two imbalanced datasets. Experimental results show that (1) 1D-2D-CNN model can achieve the performance for classifying both Australia and Brazil frog calls. (2) Focal loss is the best among four loss functions for classifying low SNR recordings. (3) The highest macro F1-score for classifying both Australia and Brazil frog recordings are 89.26\%+/- 0.36\% and 93.47\%+/- 0.28\%.",Bioacoustic signal classification;Loss function;Convolutional neural network,ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,2021,SEP,Article,English,Ecology

They differ in plumage characteristics (such as red versus black belly patches; supercilium color and extent; and white versus black throats), in lifestyle (resident versus migratory) and in vocalizations. We investigated the morphological, bioacoustic and ecological differences across all taxa after recent studies demostrated the importance of these traits in recognizing biological species limits across pittas. Methods Morphometric analysis was carried out by measuring tarsus, wing, tail and bill lengths of 15 specimens at the Natural History Museum, UK, and plumages were inspected across 106 unique individuals from four different repositories. Bioacoustic analysis was based on 134 range-wide sound recordings. Two types of calls, territorial calls and alarm calls, were analyzed using different sets of parameters. Principal component analysis and the Isler Criterion were applied to the measurements. Playback trials were conducted to explore the levels of response of each taxon to the call types of the other taxa. Results The territorial call of concinna exhibits a distinct two-element motif, while elegans, maria and virginalis utter a three-element motif in which the first two elements are given in quick succession. On the other hand, vigorsii, produces both two-element and three-element motifs with longer breaks in between elements. As further corroborated by the playback trials, the three taxa elegans, virginalis and maria form a tight vocal cluster, whereas each concinna and vigorsii are distinct. The alarm call turned out to be less diagnostic even though most taxa did roughly separate into different vocal clusters. Morphometric analysis failed to produce strong differences, but plumage distinctions among multiple taxa are pronounced. Conclusions We suggest splitting the Elegant Pitta into three biological species based on bioacoustic and-less so-plumage evidence: (1) Temminck's Elegant Pitta P. elegans (including subspecies elegans, virginalis and maria), (2) Wallace's Elegant Pitta P. concinna (monotypic), and (3) Banda Elegant Pitta P. vigorsii (monotypic).",Bioacoustic analysis;Elegant Pitta;Morphometric analysis;Pitta elegans;Territorial calls,AVIAN RESEARCH,2020,OCT 28,Article,English,Ornithology

Short-time analysis of audio signals having different durations result in sets of feature vectors having different cardinalities. Support vector machines handle such varying-length feature sets using dynamic kernels, such as the intermediate matching kernel (IMK). IMK works by utilizing the so-called virtual vectors which select pairs of feature vectors to learn discrimination between classes. Existing formulations of IMK choose virtual vectors from the most information-hearing regions of classes, such as cluster means. This form of IMK completely ignores the feature vector pairs that lie around the class boundaries. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative formulation of IMK based on archetypal analysis (AA) and deep archetypal analysis (DAA). AA represents the data in terms of boundary elements, whereas DAA represents data in terms of both boundary and average elements. The proposed AA and DAA based intermediate matching kernel (AA/DAA-IMK) utilizes the elements generated from AA and DAA as the virtual feature vectors. Experimental evaluation on four different bioacoustic datasets show that the introduction of AA and DAA into the IMK framework leads to a noticeable improvement in classification accuracy.",Deep archetypal analysis based IMK;bioacoustic classification;bird species classification;kernel methods,IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN SIGNAL PROCESSING,2019,MAY,Article,English,"Engineering, Electrical \& Electronic"

Acoustic pattern recognition techniques allow for automated identification of species and an estimation of species composition within ecosystems. Here we describe an approach where on the basis of long term acoustic recordings not only the occurrence of a species was documented, but where the number of vocalizing animals was also estimated. This approach allows us to follow up changes in population density and to define breeding sites in a changing environment. We present the results of five years of continuous acoustic monitoring of Eurasian bittern (Botaurus stellaris) in a recent wetland restoration area. Using a setup consisting of four four-channel recorders equipped with cardioid microphones we recorded vocal activity during entire nights. Vocalizations of bitterns were detected on the recordings by spectrogram template matching. On basis of time differences of arrival (TDOA) of the acoustic signals at different recording devices booming bitterns could be mapped using hyperbolic localization. During the study period not only changes in the number of calling birds but also changes in their spatial distribution connected with changes in habitat structure could be documented. This semi-automated approach towards monitoring birds described here could be applied to a wide range of monitoring tasks for animals with long distance vocalizations.

Employing learnable or handcrafted encoders, BioCPPNet operates directly on the raw acoustic mixture waveform containing overlapping vocalizations and separates the input waveform into estimates corresponding to the sources in the mixture. Predictions are compared to the reference ground truth waveforms by searching over the space of (output, target) source order permutations, and we train using an objective function motivated by perceptual audio quality. We apply BioCPPNet to several species with unique vocal behavior, including macaques, bottlenose dolphins, and Egyptian fruit bats, and we evaluate reconstruction quality of separated waveforms using the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) and downstream identity classification accuracy. We consider mixtures with two or three concurrent conspecific vocalizers, and we examine separation performance in open and closed speaker scenarios. To our knowledge, this paper redefines the state-of-the-art in end-to-end single-channel bioacoustic source separation in a permutation-invariant regime across a heterogeneous set of non-human species.

This paper proposes a new bioacoustic signal enhancement technique which can be used on a wide range of species. The technique is based on a perceptually scaled wavelet packet decomposition using a species-specific Greenwood scale function. Spectral estimation techniques, similar to those used for human speech enhancement, are used for estimation of clean signal wavelet coefficients under an additive noise model. The new approach is compared to several other techniques, including basic bandpass filtering as well as classical speech enhancement methods such as spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, and Ephraim-Malah filtering. Vocalizations recorded from several species are used for evaluation, including the ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeanglia), with both additive white Gaussian noise and environment recording noise added across a range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Results, measured by both SNR and segmental SNR of the enhanced wave forms, indicate that the proposed method outperforms other approaches for a wide range of noise conditions.

The VE and BR are classified by the machine learning techniques extracting the graph features - the number of edges (E), graph density (D), transitivity (T), degree centrality (D-cg) and eigenvector centrality (E-cg). The higher value of E, D, and T in BR indicates the temporally correlated airflow through the wider tracheobronchial tract resulting in sustained high-intense low-frequencies. The frequency spread and high-frequencies in VE, arising due to the less correlated airflow through the narrow segmental bronchi and lobar, appears as a lower value for E, D, and T.

The HMI concept is based on monitoring volitional bioacoustic activity generated through prescribed tongue motions. In this paper, a heterogeneous decoding framework is presented, enabling effective real-time polychotomous classification between the various tongue actions and dichotomous discrimination of unintended bioacoustic activity from the volitional signals. Using this customised framework and developed software, the real-time performance was evaluated for both three (six subjects) and four action (four subjects) discrimination, using healthy subjects. Ignoring false negative rejections, the system achieved sensitivities of >90\% for three-action discrimination and >80\% for four action discrimination, across all tested subjects.

This included a subset of low frequency interference signals with similar temporal characteristics and frequency distributions as the volitional tongue activity.

To highlight the potential of the system for substituting or augmenting existing assistive interfaces, a case study is presented demonstrating the utility of TMEP signals for hand prosthesis control. Full tongue control was evaluated against three alternative control strategies, namely natural human-hand manipulation, proportional-based control and a hybrid strategy, when performing an everyday object manipulation task.

We tested whether bioacoustic monitoring of multiple gender- and age-specific vocalizations of the imperiled tricolored blackbird Agelaius tricolor could provide detailed information on reproductive phenology and breeding success. Using inexpensive cell phones and free software applications, we collected audio recordings of tricolored blackbird colonies during their breeding season. Adding solar panels enabled the stations to run autonomously, and use of cellular data enabled remote uploading of recordings. Analysis of the presence or absence of three vocalizations-male song, female song, and nestling call-provided a rich and detailed description of the breeding phenology including the dates for courtship; onset of nest building, incubation, and nestling hatching; and fledgling departure from nesting colonies.

The tag successfully recorded reef fish vocalizations, boat engine noise, the sound of the shark feeding and unidentified rhythmic sounds that may derive from shark tail beats.

Common methods such as deep clustering, however, cannot be applied to signals of an unknown number of sources and/or signals that overlap in time and/or frequency-a common problem in bioacoustic recordings. This work presents an approach, using a supervised learning framework, to parse individual sources from a spectrogram of a mixture that contains a variable number of overlapping sources. This method isolates individual sources in the time-frequency domain using only one function but in two separate steps, one for the detection of the number of sources and corresponding bounding boxes, and a second step for the segmentation in which masks of individual sounds are extracted. This approach handles the full separation of overlapping sources in both time and frequency using deep neural networks in an applicable manner to other tasks such as bird audio detection. This paper presents method and reports on its performance to parse individual bat signals from recordings containing hundreds of overlapping bat echolocation signals. This method can be extended to other bioacoustic recordings with a variable number of sources and signals that overlap in time and/or frequency.",,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,2020,MAR,Article,English,Acoustics;Audiology \& Speech-Language Pathology

Bruchids hidden inside the grain kernels were detected acoustically through amplification and filtering of their mobility and feeding sounds. The multivariate technique of artificial neural network (ANN) was applied to assess and predict the bruchids' density in bulk stored legumes. Five levels of bruchids density (0, 5, 10 15 and 20 bruchids per 500 g) were monitored under without insulation and with insulated condition on the basis of formant parameter obtained by analysis of the acoustic sensor data. The K fold validation method with back propagation multilayer perceptron methodology was used for the prediction of bruchids densities. The maximum and minimum values of accuracy (R-2) of 0.99, 0.98 and 0.90, 0.89 could be achieved for both bruchids in stored green gram and chickpea under insulation and without insulation for the training and validation dataset, respectively. Least RMSE (0.82 and 0.89) was obtained for C. maculatus in sound insulated stored green gram for training and validation dataset, respectively. The accuracy of prediction and validation of experimental data with low RMSE and high R-2 values for both the food legumes indicated that the ANN modeling performed well in predicting bruchids density. Hence it can be concluded that, best prediction was obtained for the C. maculatus for green gram under insulated condition. The results further corroborated that bioacoustic detection technique with ANN provided a reliable and accurate monitoring technique for bruchids. The developed technique can be adopted in large bulk storage grain systems for the selected legumes for predicting and assessing the growth of bruchids thereby leading to safer storage.

For the present, acoustic monitoring can assist in ecological research and increase the chances of a species being detected, described, and hence protected. For the future, the collected time-series of audio recordings will compose bioacoustic time capsules, providing singular historical information on the structure and dynamics of past ecosystems and the activity of extinct fauna (acoustic fossils).

Human activities may disturb or affect some bird activities. Therefore, it is important to monitor and study the relationships between human and animal activities. This paper proposed a system able not only to automatically classify human and bird activities using bioacoustic data, but also to automatically summarize patterns of events over time. To perform automatic summarization of acoustic events, a frequency-duration graph (FDG) framework was proposed to summarize the patterns of human and bird activities. This system first performs data pre-processing work on raw bioacoustic data and then applies a support vector machine (SVM) model and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model to classify human and bird chirping activities before using the FDG framework to summarize results. The SVM model achieved 98\% accuracy on average and the MLP model achieved 98\% accuracy on average across several day-long recordings. Three case studies with real data show that the FDG framework correctly determined the patterns of human and bird activities over time and provided both statistical and graphical insight into the relationships between these two events.",bioacoustics;patterns of events;event classification;human activities,FORESTS,2019,OCT,Article,English,Forestry

Using an unusually large bioacoustic dataset, we studied patterns of vocal differentiation among populations of the widespread Striped Tit-Babbler Mixornis gularis complex. We demonstrate diagnostic differences in song characteristics between distant populations found on separate landmasses, but we show that these differences emerge as clinal once populations on small, rarely-sampled and geographically intermediate islands are included in the analysis. This pattern suggests bioacoustic clinality among different island members of the complex in contrast to results from previous morphological research. Our vocal data additionally uncover cases of potential erroneous taxon attribution and confirm cases of suggested synonymizations in this complicated species complex.

In this work we show how a bioacoustic record from the Dedan Kimathi University wildlife conservancy, a conservancy in the Mount Kenya ecosystem, was obtained in a cost effective manner. A subset of the dataset was annotated with the identities of bird species present since they serve as useful indicator species. These data reveal the spatial distribution of species within the conservancy and also point to the effects of major highways on bird populations. This dataset will provide data to train automatic species recognition systems for birds found within the Mount Kenya ecosystem. Such systems are necessary if bioacoustic approaches are to be employed at the large scales necessary to influence wildlife conservation measures.

In this work, we first present a novel technique for automatic segmentation of anuran calls in real time; then, we present a method to assess the performance of the whole system. The proposed segmentation method performs an unsupervised binary classification of time series (audio) that incrementally computes two exponentially-weighted features (Energy and Zero Crossing Rate). In our proposal, classical sliding temporal windows are replaced with counters that give higher weights to new data, allowing us to distinguish between a syllable and ambient noise (considered as silences). Compared to sliding-window approaches, the associated memory cost of our proposal is lower, and processing speed is higher. Our evaluation of the segmentation component considers three metrics: (1) the Matthews Correlation Coefficient for point-to-point comparison; (2) the WinPR to quantify the precision of boundaries; and (3) the AEER for event-to-event counting. The experiments were carried out in a dataset with 896 syllables of seven different species of anurans. To evaluate the whole system, we derived four equations that helps understand the impact that the precision and recall of the segmentation component has on the classification task. Finally, our experiments show a segmentation/recognition improvement of 37\%, while reducing memory and data communication. Therefore, results suggest that our proposal is suitable for resource-constrained systems, such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

This hinders the effective utilization of state-of-the-art deep learning models in bioacoustics. To overcome this problem, the authors propose a deep metric learning-based framework that provides effective classification, even when only a small number of per-class training examples are available. The proposed framework utilizes a multiscale convolutional neural network and the proposed dynamic variant of the triplet loss to learn a transformation space where intra-class separation is minimized and inter-class separation is maximized by a dynamically increasing margin. The process of learning this transformation is known as deep metric learning. The triplet loss analyzes three examples (referred to as a triplet) at a time to perform deep metric learning. The number of possible triplets increases cubically with the dataset size, making triplet loss more suitable than the cross-entropy loss in data-scarce conditions. Experiments on three different publicly available datasets show that the proposed framework performs better than existing bioacoustic classification methods. Experimental results also demonstrate the superiority of dynamic triplet loss over cross-entropy loss in data-scarce conditions. Furthermore, unlike existing bioacoustic classification methods, the proposed framework has been extended to provide open-set classification.

However, the method used to collect acoustic index data can be made more effective by recent developments in electronics. The current process requires recording high-quality audio in the field and computing acoustic indices in the lab.

Survey methods using automated bioacoustic recorders offer significant promise, especially for species whose behaviour or ecology reduces their detectability during traditional surveys, such as the European nightjar. In this study we examined the utility of automated bioacoustic recorders and the associated classification software as a way to survey for wildlife, using the nightjar as an example. We compared traditional human surveys with results obtained from bioacoustic recorders. When we compared these two methods using the recordings made at the same time as the human surveys, we found that recorders were better at detecting nightjars. However, in practice fieldworkers are likely to deploy recorders for extended periods to make best use of them. Our comparison of this practical approach with human surveys revealed that recorders were significantly better at detecting nightjars than human surveyors: recorders detected nightjars during 19 of 22 survey periods, while surveyors detected nightjars on only six of these occasions. In addition, there was no correlation between the amount of vocalisation captured by the acoustic recorders and the abundance of nightjars as recorded by human surveyors. The data obtained from the recorders revealed that nightjars were most active just before dawn and just after dusk, and least active during the middle of the night. As a result, we found that recording at both dusk and dawn or only at dawn would give reasonably high levels of detection while significantly reducing recording time, preserving battery life. Our analyses suggest that automated bioacoustic recorders could increase the detection of other species, particularly those that are known to be difficult to detect using traditional survey methods. The accuracy of detection is especially important when the data are used to inform conservation.",,PLOS ONE,2014,JUL 16,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

Automated procedures allow rapid, repeatable, and objective categorization, but often perform poorly at detecting biologically meaningful sound classes. Arguably this is because many automated methods fail to address the nonlinearities of animal sound perception. We present a new method of categorization that incorporates dynamic time-warping and an adaptive resonance theory (ART) neural network. This method was tested on 104 randomly chosen whistle contours from four captive bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), as well as 50 frequency contours extracted from calls of transient killer whales (Orcinus orca). The dolphin data included known biologically meaningful categories in the form of 42 stereotyped whistles produced when each individual was isolated from its group. The automated procedure correctly grouped all but two stereotyped whistles into separate categories, thus performing as well as human observers. The categorization of killer whale calls largely corresponded to visual and aural categorizations by other researchers. These results suggest that this methodology provides a repeatable and objective means of dividing bioacoustic signals into biologically meaningful categories.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an image classification technique that can be operated on the spectrogram of an audio recording.

We used AlexNet to classify spectrograms of audio clips from 19 species of birdsong. We trained and tested AlexNet with the spectrograms and observed that mean classification accuracy ranged from 88.9\% to 96.9\% depending on the parameters used to create the spectrogram. Classification accuracy was highest when we used a composite of four spectrograms with different combinations of scales for frequency and amplitude. Classification accuracy also varied depending on the FFT window size of the spectrogram.

A better fit between measurements and model predictions was achieved by increasing the values of the internal delay over those measured previously. The measurements presented here indicate high inter-individual variability of the parameters of the internal pathway, with a range of 60 degrees for the internal phase delay. Calculating the directional characteristics using this range of values for the internal delay indicated that sufficient directional information was available down to 5 kHz. Increasing the value of the internal delay over that measured in an earlier study therefore provides an explanation for the discrepancy between the poor directional information attributed to C. biguttulus in that study and the excellent lateralization ability of males of this species at 5 kHz.",hearing;bioacoustic model;Schistocerca gregaria;Chorthippus biguttulus;directional hearing;sound localization;pressure difference receiver,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,1999,JAN,Article,English,Biology

These measurements are typically made using light-weight accelerometers and/or air-coupled microphones attached to the skin. Although normally neglected, air-borne sounds generated by the subject or other sources of background noise can easily corrupt such recordings, which is particularly critical in the recording of voiced sounds on the skin surface. In this study, the sensitivity of commonly used bioacoustic sensors to air-borne sounds was evaluated and compared with their sensitivity to tissue-borne body sounds. To delineate the sensitivity to each pathway, the sensors were first tested in vitro and then on human subjects. The results indicated that, in general, the air-borne sensitivity is sufficiently high to significantly corrupt body sound signals. In addition, the air-borne and tissue-borne sensitivities can be used to discriminate between these components. Although the study is focused on the evaluation of voiced sounds on the skin surface, an extension of the proposed methods to other bioacoustic applications is discussed.",Accelerometers;acoustic transducers;biomedical acoustics;biomedical transducers;microphones;respiratory acoustics;skin vibration;speech analysis,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,2009,FEB,Article,English,"Engineering, Biomedical"

Six experiments were devised for testing the accuracy obtained for each spectrogram representation and architecture combination. Results show that binary spectrograms with both linear and pyramidal architectures with dropout provide a classification rate of 94-99\% on the training and 92-98\% on the testing set, respectively. The pyramidal network presents a shorter training and inference time. Results from the convolutional neural networks (CNN) are substantially better when compared with a signal processing fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based harmonic search approach in terms of accuracy and F1 Score.

Deriving per-species abundance estimates from these sensors requires detection, classification, and quantification of animal vocalizations as individual acoustic events. Yet, variability in ambient noise, both over time and across sensors, hinders the reliability of current automated systems for sound event detection (SED), such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) in the time-frequency domain. In this article, we develop, benchmark, and combine several machine listening techniques to improve the generalizability of SED models across heterogeneous acoustic environments. As a case study, we consider the problem of detecting avian flight calls from a ten-hour recording of nocturnal bird migration, recorded by a network of six ARUs in the presence of heterogeneous background noise. Starting from a CNN yielding state-of-the-art accuracy on this task, we introduce two noise adaptation techniques, respectively integrating short-term (60 ms) and long-term (30 min) context. First, we apply per-channel energy normalization (PCEN) in the time-frequency domain, which applies short-term automatic gain control to every subband in the mel-frequency spectrogram. Secondly, we replace the last dense layer in the network by a context-adaptive neural network (CA-NN) layer, i.e. an affine layer whose weights are dynamically adapted at prediction time by an auxiliary network taking long-term summary statistics of spectrotemporal features as input. We show that PCEN reduces temporal overfitting across dawn vs. dusk audio clips whereas context adaptation on PCEN-based summary statistics reduces spatial overfitting across sensor locations. Moreover, combining them yields state-of-the-art results that are unmatched by artificial data augmentation alone. We release a pre-trained version of our best performing system under the name of BirdVoxDetect, a ready-to-use detector of avian flight calls in field recordings.",,PLOS ONE,2019,OCT 24,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

The playback of species-specific bioacoustic alarm stimuli has been one of the most promising methods suggested to deal with bird-problems. However, no published studies have tested this method on species of parrots, one of the main avian pests of crops in Australia and globally. Furthermore the effectiveness of this method might be reduced if alarm calls were played back that came from a non-local population. The Crimson Rosella species complex (Platycercus elegans), a parrot with considerable acoustic variation throughout its range, is considered a pest species of several commercial fruit crops. This study tested whether alarm calls from Crimson Rosellas were effective in reducing the activity of Rosellas in apple orchards. Three groups of bioacoustic stimuli were compared: control stimuli, local alarm calls and non-local alarm calls. Our results indicate that the playback of alarm calls from Crimson Rosellas is effective in reducing the activity of Rosellas in orchards over the period of study, and we did not find any difference between the use of local and non-local alarm calls.

Some innovative techniques such as the use of drones-also called unmanned aerial vehicle/system (UAV/UAS)-offer promising opportunities. The potential of UAS-based wildlife census using high-resolution imagery is now well established for terrestrial mammals or birds that can be seen on images. Nevertheless, the ability of UASs to detect non-conspicuous species, such as small birds below the forest canopy, remains an open question. This issue can be solved with bioacoustics for acoustically active species such as bats and birds. In this context, UASs represent an interesting solution that could be deployed on a larger scale, at lower risk for the operator, and over hard-to-reach locations, such as forest canopies or complex topographies, when compared with traditional protocols (fixed location recorders placed or handled by human operators). In this context, this study proposes a methodological framework to assess the potential of UASs in bioacoustic surveys for birds and bats, using low-cost audible and ultrasound recorders mounted on a low-cost quadcopter UAS (DJI Phantom 3 Pro). The proposed methodological workflow can be straightforwardly replicated in other contexts to test the impact of other UAS bioacoustic recording platforms in relation to the targeted species and the specific UAS design. This protocol allows one to evaluate the sensitivity of UAS approaches through the estimate of the effective detection radius for the different species investigated at several flight heights. The results of this study suggest a strong potential for the bioacoustic monitoring of birds but are more contrasted for bat recordings, mainly due to quadcopter noise (i.e., electronic speed controller (ESC) noise) but also, in a certain manner, to the experimental design (use of a directional speaker with limited call intensity). Technical developments, such as the use of a winch to safely extent the distance between the UAS and the recorder during UAS sound recordings or the development of an innovative platform, such as a plane-blimp hybrid UAS, should make it possible to solve these issues.",drone;UAS;UAV;bioacoustics;birds;bats;wildlife census;ultrasound,DRONES,2021,MAR,Article,English,Remote Sensing

A quantitative integration of behavioural characters, such as vocalizations, in studies on biotic differentiation has arisen more recently, and the relative importance of these different traits in the diversification process remains poorly understood. To provide a framework within which to interpret the evolutionary interplay between morphological and behavioural traits, we generated a draft genome of a cryptic Southeast Asian songbird, the limestone wren-babbler Napothera crispifrons. We resequenced whole genomes of multiple individuals of all three traditional subspecies and of a distinct leucistic population. We demonstrate strong genomic and mitochondrial divergence among all three taxa, pointing to the existence of three species-level lineages. Despite its great phenotypic distinctness, the leucistic population was characterized by shallow genomic differentiation from its neighbour, with only a few localized regions emerging as highly diverged. Quantitative bioacoustic analysis across multiple traits revealed deep differences especially between the two taxa characterized by limited plumage differentiation. Our study demonstrates that differentiation in these furtive songbirds has resulted in a complex mosaic of colour-based and bioacoustic differences among populations. Extreme colour differences can be anchored in few genomic loci and may therefore arise and subside rapidly.",cryptic plumage;genomic landscape;limestone wren\&\#8208;babbler;passerine;vocalization,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2021,JAN,Article,English,Biochemistry \& Molecular Biology;Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

In 1900, populations from the Sula archipelago were awarded subspecies status T. manadensis sulaensis based on smaller size and minor differences in plumage; however, this distinction has not been corroborated subsequently, and T. manadensis is considered by most modern sources to be monotypic across its range. Methods: We conducted vocal analysis of the cuckoo-doves' main song using recordings collected from across the taxon's natural range. Descriptive information on the songs was obtained from the recordings using bioacoustic analysis software, after which several statistical methods were used to investigate differences in vocalizations among populations. Results: We report deep bioacoustic divergences in vocal trait pattern from across the cuckoo-doves' range, with birds from Peleng and Taliabu in the east having a different vocal trait pattern from birds from Sulawesi, Buton, and Togian in the west. These patterns agree with changes in landmass that accompanied the sea level fluctuations caused by Pleistocene glacial cycles, and indicate that eastern and western cuckoo-dove populations are at the level of different biological species. Conclusions: We propose that the eastern taxon be elevated to species level as T. sulaensis. Given the rampant degree of habitat destruction in its limited range, this taxonomic change will have important implications on the conservation status of T. sulaensis.",Wallacea;Sulawesi;Peleng;Taliabu;Buton;Pleistocene;Island biogeography,AVIAN RESEARCH,2016,JAN 26,Article,English,Ornithology

Its early detection is difficult, since palm trees do not show visual evidence of infection until it is too late for them to recover. For this reason the development of efficient early detection mechanisms is a critical element of RPW pest management systems. One of the early detection mechanisms proposed in the literature is based on acoustic monitoring, as the activity of RPW larvae inside the palm trunk is audible for human operators under acceptable environmental noise levels (rural areas, night periods, etc.). In this work we propose the design of an autonomous bioacoustic sensor that can be installed in every palm tree under study and is able to analyze the captured audio signal during large periods of time. The results of the audio analysis would be reported wirelessly to a control station, to be subsequently processed and conveniently stored. That control station is to be accessible via the Internet. It is programmed to send warning messages when predefined alarm thresholds are reached, thereby allowing supervisors to check on-line the status and evolution of the palm tree orchards. We have developed a bioacoustic sensor prototype and performed an extensive set of experiments to measure its detection capability, achieving average detection rates over 90\%.",pest detection;acoustic signal processing;wavelet transform;pattern matching;acoustic sensor design;wireless sensor networks,SENSORS,2013,FEB,Article,English,"Chemistry, Analytical;Engineering, Electrical \& Electronic;Instruments \& Instrumentation"

By analyzing temporal and spectral parameters of the advertisement calls, we report that the signals of northern, central, and southern populations have remarkable differences between them. A phylogeographical analysis from a mitochondrial DNA fragment demonstrated three phylogenetic groups coincident with those found with the bioacoustics analysis. Furthermore, bioacoustic and genetic distances show significant correlations after controlling for geographical distance. These results suggest that behavioural divergence among populations of P.thaul has a phylogenetic basis, supporting three evolutionary units within this species, as well as prompting the exploration of divergence processes in the sound communication system of this species.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 142-155.",acoustic communication;advertisement call;Pleurodema thaul;variation,BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,2013,SEP,Article,English,Evolutionary Biology

In these surveys, animals are typically counted regardless of their distance from the survey point. When these surveys are carried out in patchy habitat or near edges, detected individuals may frequently occur in a different land-cover type than the survey point itself, which introduces uncertainty regarding species-habitat associations. We propose a method to restrict detections from single microphones to within a pre-specified survey radius. The method uses logistic regression to select a sound level threshold corresponding to the desired distance threshold. We applied this method to acoustic data from the centre of 21 1-ha oil wellsites in northern Alberta. To compare our approach with the results from auditory surveys from the same locations, we used sound localisation to locate birds detected via both methods. Just 22.4\% of birds detected on auditory surveys fell within the desired survey area. Using our distance-truncation method, 96\% of detections were within the desired survey area. We propose that distance truncation via sound level will be useful for surveys of patchily distributed habitat, or when greater certainty about bird locations or habitat associations is desired.",Autonomous recording unit;bird surveys;distance estimation;limited-radius surveys;sound level;population monitoring,BIOACOUSTICS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SOUND AND ITS RECORDING,2021,MAY 4,Article,English,Zoology

Since the vibrations are a direct result of the airflow, accurate timing of inspiration and expiration is possible. This paper presents a signal analysis solution for automated monitoring of breathing and calculation of the breathing frequency. The signal analysis approach uses tracheal sound variables in the time and frequency domains, as well as the characteristics of the disturbances that can be used to discriminate tracheal sound from noise. One problem associated with the bioacoustic method is its sensitivity for acoustic disturbances, because the microphone tends to pick up all vibrations, independent of their origin. A signal processing method was developed that makes the bioacoustic method clinically useful in a broad variety of situations, for example in intensive care and during certain heart examinations, where information about both the precise timing and the phases of breathing is crucial.

We conducted bioacoustic examinations using principal component analysis and the Isler criterion to quantitatively test species boundaries within the G. brodiei complex. In addition, we compared plumage colouration among 13 specimens of the G. brodiei complex deposited at the Natural History Museum at Tring, UK and the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, Singapore to ascertain the presence of plumage differences across taxa. Results We found the Bornean and Sumatran populations vocally similar to each other, but distinctly different from the mainland and Taiwan populations.

Here, we tested the utility of acoustic measurements in shallow coastal waters by conducting short-term simultaneous bio acoustic and biodiversity surveys in 4 habitat types on the Caribbean coast of Panama: mangrove, reef, seagrass, and sand. Acoustic measurements in the `low band' (<1000 Hz) were positively correlated with cryptic fish richness and abundance, but this band was dominated by the calls of a single species, the Bocon toadfish. Toadfish calls masked other fish sounds and confounded results from recently developed eco-acoustic indices such as acoustic entropy and acoustic complexity. The `high band' (3000-10 000 Hz), largely indicative of snapping-shrimp sound production, did not differ significantly across habitat types and was not correlated to biodiversity measurements. Our study demonstrates that bioacoustic surveys can help scientists detect certain cryptic, soniferous species, justifying their use in tandem with traditional biodiversity surveys.

Despite this growing popularity, there still is widespread scepticism in the academic world about the validity and quality of data from citizen science projects. And although there might be great potential, citizen science is a rarely used approach in the field of bioacoustics. To better understand the possibilities, but also the limitations, we here evaluated data generated in a citizen science project on nightingale song as a case study. We analysed the quantity and quality of song recordings made in a non-standardized way with a smartphone app by citizen scientists and the standardized recordings made with professional equipment by academic researchers. We made comparisons between the recordings of the two approaches and among the user types of the app to gain insights into the temporal recording patterns, the quantity and quality of the data. To compare the deviation of the acoustic parameters in the recordings with smartphones and professional devices from the original song recordings, we conducted a playback test. Our results showed that depending on the user group, citizen scientists produced many to a lot of recordings of valid quality for further bioacoustic research. Differences between the recordings provided by the citizen and the expert group were mainly caused by the technical quality of the devices used-and to a lesser extent by the citizen scientists themselves. Especially when differences in spectral parameters are to be investigated, our results demonstrate that the use of the same high-quality recording devices and calibrated external microphones would most likely improve data quality. We conclude that many bioacoustic research questions may be carried out with the recordings of citizen scientists. We want to encourage academic researchers to get more involved in participatory projects to harness the potential of citizen science-and to share scientific curiosity and discoveries more directly with society.",,PLOS ONE,2021,JUN 28,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

Taxa with closely related highland and lowland species, such as the East-African White-eye birds, allow testing for the potential effects of the two contrasting distribution patterns, mountain disjunction versus lowland panmixia. In this study, we compare the population genetic and bioacoustic differentiation of two representatives of the genus Zosterops: Zosterops poliogaster is exclusively found in forests at higher elevations; in comparison, Zosterops abyssinicus, only occurs in the dry and warm lowland savannahs. Both species were analysed across a similar geographical scale. Population genetic differentiation was inferred using the same set of 15 polymorphic microsatellite loci for both species. In addition, we quantitatively analyzed bioacoustic traits. Both data sets indicate a strong population differentiation among populations of the highland species, but an absence of differentiation in the lowland species. In addition, the lowland Z. abyssinicus was characterised by a twofold higher genetic diversity than detected for the highland Z. poliogaster. These two contrasting intraspecific population structures may reflect the opposite ecology and distribution of these species: the strong population isolation of Z. poliogaster resulting from long-term restriction to the cool and moist mountain forests at higher elevations has led to strong differentiation among local populations and resulted in a comparatively low level of intraspecific variability. In contrast, population panmixia in the lowland Z. abyssinicus provides a high level of gene flow allowing the maintenance of high genetic diversity and avoiding strong population structuring.

Physical barriers may help retain fish in reservoirs but are often not practical due to high reservoir debris loads and maintenance requirements of these structures. As an alternative, nonphysical barriers may also be successful at increasing fish retention in reservoirs through the use of negative stimuli that divert fish away from targeted locations. However, the effectiveness of nonphysical barriers can vary considerably among barrier stimuli and fish species because the barrier's success is dependent upon on a behavioral response from fish. We conducted a laboratory experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of a bioacoustic bubble-strobe light barrier at reducing Walleye Sander vitreus escapement rates. We hypothesized that increasing the number and frequency of barrier stimuli would result in Walleyes approaching the barrier less frequently, reduced escapement, and increased amount of time before escapement occurred. Walleyes approached the barrier and were successfully deterred most often when lights were off and sound was on. Walleye escapement rates declined from 89.3\% with the barrier off to 44.1\% with low and medium sound, whereas up to 100\% of the fish escaped with the addition of light. Mean time before escapement and time to 50\% escapement increased with the use of sound, whereas fish escaped in less time when light was used as a deterrent. Most Walleyes escaped around sunset indicating that fish were most active during the crepuscular period. Despite reductions in escapement associated with sound-bubble barriers, we recommend that alternative nonphysical barriers be evaluated for their potential to further increase retention of Walleyes before installation of sound barrier deterrent systems in reservoirs.",,NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT,2014,,Article,English,Fisheries

Real time detection at an early stage of insect infestation can overcome the foremost problem of infestation. Acoustic detection method detects the hidden as well as moving insects by amplifying and filtering their motility and feeding sounds. Crawling and feeding activities of two insects Callosobruchus chinensis and Callosobruchus maculatus in chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and green gram (Vigna radiata) were detected by using an insect detection probe placed in an acoustically insulated bin. Temperature and relative humidity were also measured through sensors mounted on the same probe. Captured sounds were pre-screened and analysed by using sound analysis software. Significant differences were found between the amplitude of two insects in both the legumes. Amplitudes of Callosobruchus chinensis were 79.32 dB and 84.01 dB for 59 ms duration in chickpea and green gram, respectively, whereas, the amplitude of Callosobruchus maculatus was 97.65 dB and 95.53 dB for 68 ms in chickpea and green gram, respectively. The detection range of the acoustic sensor was 300 mm omnidirectional. Formants (F1, F2, F3 and F4), formant bandwidth (FBW3), frequency and spectral power were observed as principal components for the detection of insects' infestation (C. chinensis and C. maculatus) in bulk stored food legumes (chickpea and green gram).

We used spectral estimation techniques to determine frequency response and cross-correlation of pulses to determine pulse shape fidelity. The sensors evaluated were the Siemens EMT 25 C accelerometer (Siemens); PPG 201 accelerometer (PPG); Sony ECM-T150 electret condenser microphone with air coupler (air coupler; with cylindrical air chambers of 5-, 10-, and 15-mm diameter and conical air chamber of 10- mm diameter); Littman classic stethoscope head (Littman) connected to an electret condenser microphone; and the Andries Tek (Andries) electronic stethoscope. We found that the size and shape of the air coupler chamber to have no important effect on the detected sound. The Siemens, air coupler, and Littman performed similarly with relatively flat frequency responses from 200 to 1,200 Hz. The PPG had the broadest frequency response, with useful sensitivity extending to 4,000 Hz. The Andries' frequency response was the poorest above 1,000 Hz. Accuracy in reproducing pulses roughly corresponded with the high-frequency sensitivity of the sensors.

In the present study, we use automated ultrasound detectors to provide information about seasonal activity of the greater noctule bat (Nyctalus lasiopterus), the largest and one of least known European bats. We selected localities within Central Europe with diverse geomorphological contexts, including rivers of different sizes and mountain passes. The study demonstrates the capability of the automatic recording approach to achieve bioacoustic discrimination of this species, but also pointed to the persistent need of integrating results from automatic classification software applications with the feedback from manual approaches. The high throughput capacity of the assay proved to be efficient, and the regular occurrence of the species was identified at two localities. These locations are associated with two known and intensely used migratory corridors of winged animals going through Vltava River valley and Cervenohorske Saddle in Jeseniky mountains, as illustrated also by the activity patterns of other migratory species. Together with the occurrence of spring and autumn peaks in activity, these findings are in concordance with the plesiomorphic condition in pipistrelloid bats, showing also migratory behavior, and represent further indirect evidence of migration of the greater noctule. This pattern could be facilitated by the trophic niche of the species, involving predation of migrating songbirds. Differences in phenology of migratory species observed at particular sites likely mirror position of the locality in relation to migration flyways, seasonal and geographic variation in prey availability and energy demands etc. Further application of bioacoustic monitoring and other tools is necessary to obtain detailed information about the range and movement ecology of the species in higher latitudes.",migration;automated detectors;central Europe;greater noctule;Nyctalus lasiopterus;SonoChiro;Vltava River valley;Cervenohorske Saddle,ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA,2019,MAY,Article,English,Zoology

Among several advantages to this approach are the ability to estimate variance among interpreters, obtain a permanent archival record of the point Count, reduce costs by using regular field crews to collect data vs. those skilled in bird identification, and remove impediments to breeding bird surveys due to lack of available skilled birders. In this study we first evaluated the effects of microphone configuration and digital processing methods on the quality and effectiveness of the recordings, and then evaluated how consistently skilled birders interpreted the same songbird recordings collected under a mix of environmental conditions, and related this to the commonness of the species. At the time of this evaluation, the most cost-effective configuration of the bioacoustic monitoring system included use of a 180degrees/180degrees microphone combination, a minidisc digital recording system, analog transfer of the sound data via a digital soundcard, post-processing amplification of the signal, and data storage in an MP3 format. This combination maintains high sound fidelity while minimizing both expense and data storage requirements. As recording device technology improves, the direct storage and digital transfer of WAV format files will be the preferred and most effective recording option. Despite noisy conditions due to wind and other ambient sounds for many of the recordings, interpreters showed a high level of similarity in species identification and enumeration for the 34 most abundant species. Standardized coefficient of variance increased sharply when species had fewer than 10 occurrences, suggesting that birders are more variable in their identification of rare or uncommon species.

While the impacts of logging on species diversity and distributions are well understood, little is known about the effects of logging on animal behaviours central to individual fitness and population persistence. The song rate of breeding songbirds is a behavioural trait that is often positively associated with male density and used by conspecific females as an indicator of territory and male quality. Thus, contrasting logging-induced adjustments in song rates of individual birds with population shifts may illuminate potential mechanisms underlying population distributions. We present a novel application of bioacoustic monitoring, integrating counts of individuals, songs and duets from single automated recording units (ARUs) with N-mixture models, to estimate shifts in population parameters (occupancy, abundance) and singing behaviours (per-capita song rates, per-pair duet rates) of 32 Bornean songbird species with logging. We tested hypotheses on the relationships between adjustments in behavioural and population parameters with logging, and further tested the extent to which species traits predicted behavioural and population shifts. Adjustments to singing behaviour in 59 and 53\% of species (57\% of duetting species) were concordant with differences in occupancy and abundance respectively, such that species showing reduced populations with logging also produced fewer songs per-capita, and vice versa. Species known to prefer undisturbed habitats and large-bodied species showed the most negative effects of logging on singing behaviour and population distributions. Species known to exploit degraded habitats exhibited the opposite pattern. Subdued singing in logged forests by species of conservation concern suggests limited competition between territorial males in small populations and may also signal low-quality territories. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that bioacoustic monitoring can be used to not only estimate important population parameters of occupancy and abundance across a diverse tropical songbird community, but also enables quantification of behaviours considered relevant to individual fitness, yet unobtainable with conventional methods (e.g. point counts).

Our approach is based on capturing and automatically recognizing the acoustic emission resulting from typical behaviors, e.g., locomotion and feeding, of the target pests. After acquisition the signals are amplified, filtered, parameterized, and classified by advanced machine learning methods on a portable computer. Specifically, we investigate an advanced signal parameterization scheme that relies on variable size signal segmentation. The feature vector computed for each segment of the signal is composed of the dominant harmonic, which carry information about the periodicity of the signal, and the cepstral coefficients, which carry information about the relative distribution of energy among the different spectral sub-bands. This parameterization offers a reliable representation of both the acoustic emissions of the pests of interest and the interferences from the environment. We illustrate the practical significance of our methodology on two specific cases: 1) a devastating pest for palm plantations, namely, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Olivier and 2) a pest that attacks warehouse stored rice (Oryza sativa L.), the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (both Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Dryophorinae). These pests are known in many countries around the world and contribute for significant economical loss.

Restoration monitoring is critical for understanding how birds respond to forest regeneration and for assessing the effectiveness of restoration efforts. Using bioacoustic monitoring, we recorded bird communities during both dry and wet seasons at 62 sites along a chronosequence of tropical dry forests in the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste in Costa Rica. Tropical dry forests rank among the globe's most imperiled ecosystems, adding special urgency to their restoration and accompanying restoration monitoring. We found that bird species diversity, richness, and abundance increase with measures of forest maturity. Our results show that bird communities in regenerating areas become more similar to those of undisturbed areas as forests mature. This suggests that bird communities are recovering to predisturbed conditions in regenerating sites, and that maturing tropical dry forests are home to an increasingly diverse and abundant community of birds. We conducted an additional assessment, by sampling 30 locations using point-counts that were originally surveyed 23 years ago. We found that species richness and abundance were similar across this 23-year interval, although bird community composition changed because several forest-specialist species were only detected in the later period.

Both species produced grunts that were composed of a trains of pulses, but the pulse repetition rates were distinctly different (56+/-3 s.d, vs 44+/-4 s.d, pps), Complex tone bursts (moans) were also used, but the species differed substantially in the location of the fundamental peak (240 Hz+/-12 s.d. vs 332 Hz+/-34 s.d.). Some P, adspersus males sustained these tones for over a second (812 ms+/-495 s.d.), whereas P, isidori produced shorter tones (121 ms+/-35 s.d,), During interactions with females, the two species produced the grunts and moans in distinct species-typical patterns: P. adspersus males alternated grunts with moans and P, isidori produced a single grunt followed by a succession of moans. A detailed analysis of identified individual P. adspersus showed that acoustic features constituted individual signatures which could be used by conspecifics to identify individuals. Grunt spectral peak frequency was shown to be a good predictor of male mass, with peak frequency decreasing at 72 Hz per grant. Simulated standardized courtship encounters with females revealed that males differ markedly in their apparent ability to produce sustained moans and it is suggested that this may be particularly important to females in mate selection.

Acoustic sampling methods are becoming increasingly important in biological monitoring. Sound attenuation is one of the most important dynamics affecting the utility of acoustic data as it directly affects the probability of detection of individuals by acoustic sensor arrays and especially the localization of acoustic signals necessary in telemetry studies. Therefore, models of sound attenuation are necessary to make efficient use of acoustic data in ecological monitoring and assessment applications. Models of attenuation in widespread use are based on Euclidean distance between source and sensor, which is justified under spherical attenuation of sound waves in homogeneous environments. 2. In this paper, I develop a model of sound attenuation based on a non-Euclidean cost-weighted distance metric which contains attenuation coefficients that characterize the attenuation of sound due to environmental heterogeneity in the vicinity of an acoustic sensor array. 3. I show that parameters of the proposed attenuation model can be estimated by maximum likelihood using experimental data from an array of fixed sources, thus allowing investigators who use bioacoustic methods to devise explicit models of sound attenuation in situ and apply them to localization of sources and density estimation. In addition, drawing on analogy with spatial capture-recapture models, I argue that parameters of the non-Euclidean model of attenuation can be estimated when source locations are unknown. Thus, the models can be applied to real field studies which require estimation of attenuation parameters or localization of signals. 4. Models of heterogeneous sound attenuation allow more accurate descriptions of acoustic monitoring data, and therefore should produce more accurate estimates of ecological parameters of interest, including source locations, density, and movement trajectories. Moreover, the ability to test specific hypotheses about the effects of habitat and landscape structure on sound attenuation can improve the design of acoustic monitoring arrays and lead to more efficient deployment of acoustic sensing technology.",acoustic monitoring;bioacoustics;distance sampling;least-cost path models;sound attenuation;sound pressure audiogram;spatial capture-recapture;telemetry,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2018,SEP,Article,English,Ecology

Its early detection is very difficult and when the action of the pest is discovered, normally it is too late for recovering the plant. Bioacoustic sensors provide a good alternative for early detection of this pest because larvae activity is audible while they excavate tunnels to feed. This work describes the different stages for the development of an original electronic device based on acoustic sensors for early detection of Red Palm Weevil larvae in the interior of palms. This device is based on characteristic frequencies possibly related to their feeding activity. The performed tests have demonstrated that is possible to detect two week old larvae activity studying the sound intensity around 2250 Hz in palms infested only with 5 individuals under controlled environmental conditions. The activity of other insects artificially situated in the interior of palms did not affect the response of the device, possibly because they produce different frequencies (in the range 5-7 kHz). Future work will be aimed at assessing the infestation levels. ",Frequency spectra;Larvae activity;Threshold;Insects;Active filter,CROP PROTECTION,2010,JUL,Article,English,Agronomy

While this technique has been successful in monitoring terrestrial distributions of calling birds, no published study has applied these methods to migrating birds in flight. The value of nocturnal flight call recordings can increase with the addition of three-dimensional position retrievals, which can be achieved with adjustments to existing localization techniques. Using the time difference of arrival method, we have developed a proof-of-concept acoustic microphone array that allows the three-dimensional positioning of calls within the airspace. Our array consists of six microphones, mounted in pairs at the top and bottom of three 10-m poles, arranged in an equilateral triangle with sides of 20 m. The microphone array was designed using readily available components and costs less than \$2,000 USD to build and deploy. We validate this technique using a kite-lofted GPS and speaker package, and obtain 60.1\% of vertical retrievals within the accuracy of the GPS measurements (+/- 5 m) and 80.4\% of vertical retrievals within +/- 10 m. The mean Euclidian distance between the acoustic retrievals of flight calls and the GPS truth was 9.6 m. Identification and localization of nocturnal flight calls have the potential to provide species-specific spatial characterizations of bird migration within the airspace. Even with the inexpensive equipment used in this trial, low-altitude applications such as surveillance around wind farms or oil platforms can benefit from the three-dimensional retrievals provided by this technique.",acoustics;aeroecology;recording;triangulation,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2016,OCT,Article,English,Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

The SSA method decomposes the signal into oscillatory components with physical meaning, allowing us to analyze different sound frequencies. One of the major SSA's challenges is how to choose those oscillatory components that will result in a better signal reconstruction, with less noise and distortion. We thus examine three entropy-based criterions for choosing such components. The quantifiers evaluated are: Amplitude Entropy, Spectral Entropy, and Permutation Entropy. The convergence of these quantifiers for different contamination conditions is provided. We then propose a grouping algorithm to arrange these components according to their entropy values. With the proposed rule, it is possible to identify the predominantly deterministic inner structure of the signal, in an unsupervised manner. We perform two different evaluations. First, we test a synthetic amplitude modulated signal contaminated with white, blue, pink, red, and violet color noises at 0 dB. Second, we analyze three audio calls of different anuran species recorded in the rainforest. The best quality of the recovered signal assessed through the Mean Square Error and the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio are 0.21 and 7.23 respectively for a white noise contamination applying the Permutation Entropy-based rule. Therefore, we conclude that our criterion is suitable for real scenarios under severe noise conditions, easily identifying trends and low-frequency components with a narrow band spectrum. Furthermore, we show how to derive an optimal FIR filter from SSA's components to build a specific filter bank for each species. We then present the magnitude-frequency response of the FIR filters of a bioacoustic anuran call.

Current classification algorithms utilise sound features extracted from the recording rather than the sound itself, with varying degrees of success. Neural networks that learn directly from the raw sound waveforms have been implemented in human speech recognition but the requirements of detailed labelled data have limited their use in bioacoustics. Here we test SincNet, an efficient neural network architecture that learns from the raw waveform using sinc-based filters. Results using an off-the-shelf implementation of SincNet on a publicly available bird sound dataset (NIPS4Bplus) show that the neural network rapidly converged reaching accuracies of over 65\% with limited data. Their performance is comparable with traditional methods after hyperparameter tuning but they are more efficient. Learning directly from the raw waveform allows the algorithm to select automatically those elements of the sound that are best suited for the task, bypassing the onerous task of selecting feature extraction techniques and reducing possible biases. We use publicly released code and datasets to encourage others to replicate our results and to apply SincNet to their own datasets; and we review possible enhancements in the hope that algorithms that learn from the raw waveform will become useful bioacoustic tools.",,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2021,AUG 3,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences
10.1111/aec.12228,If a frog calls in the forest: Bioacoustic monitoring reveals the breeding phenology of the endangered Richmond Range mountain frog (Philoria richmondensis),"Willacy,RosalieJ.;Mahony,Michael;Newell,DavidA.",Southern Cross University;University of Newcastle,"Amphibians are the most threatened vertebrate taxon of modern times. Baseline data and affordable methods to monitor populations are absent for many Australian frog species. Furthermore, some species are visually cryptic, and detection often relies upon male advertisement calls. Imperfect detection rates impede our ability to assess the status of populations over time. Understanding the factors that influence calling is essential to inform the timing of survey effort and increase survey efficiency. Automated recording systems offer considerable potential to determine calling phenology and establish the relationship between calling and abiotic factors. The mountain frogs (PhiloriaMyobatrachidae) of the Gondwana rainforests are considered susceptible to climate change impacts, such as shifts in the timing of calling. In order to describe the calling phenology of Philoria richmondensis, commercially available automated recording systems were deployed at five locations, and over 5000h of sound recordings were captured and analysed. Peak calling activity occurred during morning and evening periods in the austral spring. Ambient temperature was found to significantly contribute to the probability of a call occurring, with the highest frequency of calls recorded occurring between 15 degrees C and 16 degrees C, and there was a negative relationship between precipitation and calling activity. The results allow future surveys to be better targeted and provide a benchmark with which to detect changes in calling phenology over time.",automated recording system;bioacoustic monitoring;Gondwana rainforest;headwater ecosystem;phenology,AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,2015,SEP,Article,English,Ecology

Statistical power, however, to detect small but biologically meaningful changes in site occupancy as part of landscape-scale monitoring is typically low, with large - yet hereto unknown - sampling efforts likely required for rigorous inference. Therefore, we (i) assessed sampling levels and detection probabilities needed to detect small changes in site occupancy driven by both intrinsic trends and management effects, and (ii) evaluated the feasibility of using bioacoustics to simultaneously monitor a common but declining species and a rare but increasing invasive competitor within a site occupancy framework. Simulation-based power analyses indicated that detection/non-detection data collected at large numbers of sites (500-1500) can yield high statistical power (> 80\%) to detect >= 2\% annual declines in site occupancy within 10 years, but depended on the number of visits per site, initial occupancy rates, and detection probabilities. Statistical power to detect >= 30\% declines in local survival rates in 10 years was also high. Based on -6-night passive-acoustic surveys, site occupancy and detection probabilities were 0.43 and 0.50, respectively, for the common but declining species (the spotted owl), and 0.09 and 0.67, respectively, for the rare but increasing competitor (the barred owl). Simulations parameterized with these empirically-derived rates indicated that 2\% annual declines in spotted owl site occupancy could be detected with high statistical power in 10 years with 1,000 sites surveyed three times per season (year) or 1500 sites surveyed two times per season. Statistical power to detect 4\% annual increases in site occupancy for expanding barred owl populations with this sampling scheme was also high. Thus, our study yielded the novel finding that passive-acoustic monitoring can be used to detect small but potentially biologically meaningful changes in site occupancy for multiple species with very different population dynamics with high confidence. More broadly, as computational improvements bring acoustic-based whole-community identification into the realm of possibility, our approach will allow managers to rapidly assess the statistical power attainable for each species: systematic and statistically robust monitoring of entire faunal communities within a unified framework at a landscape scale may become a reality.",Acoustic surveys;Barred owls;Ecoacoustics;Invasive species;Occupancy models;Passive-acoustic monitoring;Simulations;Spotted owls;Statistical power;Threatened species,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2019,MAR,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Environmental Sciences

Mammalian species in general and cows in particular exhibit a strong mother-infant bond that is frequently expressed through vocal exchanges among mothers and their infants. Several species produce calls that are exclusively used to induce nursing behavior. We therefore predicted that calf calls would affect the behavior and biology underlying lactation in dairy cows. Playback of calf vocalizations were conducted at two dairies under controlled conditions. Exposure to calf vocalizations significantly increased milk production in experimental cows by 1-2\% in the milking session immediately following the milking session in which playbacks were conducted. The playback of calf vocalizations in the milking parlor therefore increased overall milk production (but not immediate milk release or letdown) in dairy cows. These data suggest that the use of calf vocalization playback as a bioacoustic tool provides a non-chemical alternative for increasing milk production in dairy cows. ,auditory stimuli;vocalization;lactation;maternal responsiveness;cows;calves,APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE,2002,MAY 10,Article,English,"Agriculture, Dairy \& Animal Science;Behavioral Sciences;Veterinary Sciences"

Because marked differentiation among Himalayan and Chinese populations has been recently demonstrated for a number of Phylloscopus species (or sister species) we investigated the intraspecific variation of a mitochondrial gene, songs and morphology of P. pulcher in a phylogeographic approach. Methods: We sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b, reconstructed haplotype networks and analyzed DNA polymorphism among Himalayan and Chinese populations. We measured time and frequency parameters of two distinct song types and analyzed among population-differentiation in a principal component analysis and a discriminant analysis. We also compared measurements of body size dimensions taken from museum specimens. Results: The mitochondrial haplotype network (cytb) was divided into two distinct clusters corresponding to geographic origin of samples. Pairwise genetic distances among Himalayan and Chinese mtDNA lineages account for 1.3\% which coincides with Pleistocene lineage separation at roughly 650,000 years ago. Genetic diversity is slightly higher in the Chinese part of the species' range with respect to haplotype and nucleotide diversity while the less diversified Himalayan population lineage shows signs of recent range expansion. The vocal repertoire of P. pulcher comprises two distinct verse types that are combined with short interspersed click notes to long continuous song displays. Trill verse types showed significant differences among regions in almost all measured frequency and time parameters: Chinese males displayed more rapid and more broad-banded trills at a lower pitch. In contrast, warbling verse types showed a distinctively different structure among regions: Himalayan songs consisted of repeated syllables while Chinese songs comprised repetitions of single, long and strongly modulated elements. Subtle morphological differences among specimens from the two study regions could only be confirmed for plumage coloration but not for metric characters. Conclusions: Based on the genetic and bioacoustic distinctiveness of Chinese Buff-barred Warbler populations, we recommend that the name Phylloscopus pulcher vegetus Bangs, 1913 should be re-validated for this taxon.",Phylloscopidae;Phylogeography;East-west divide;Territorial songs;Phylloscopus pulcher vegetus,AVIAN RESEARCH,2014,,Article,English,Ornithology

We conducted bioacoustic and multi-locus DNA analyses of 24 Ninox owl taxa to evaluate relationships and levels of divergence within the two complexes and ultimately assess the relationship between patterns of taxonomic differentiation and bioclimatic factors. We found that taxa that are vocally and/or genetically distinct from populations on the Australian mainland are found on islands that are significantly larger and higher in altitude than taxa that are vocally and/or genetically indistinct from populations on the Australian mainland. This pattern suggests that taxa occurring on small, low-lying Wallacean islands are likely to be recent colonisers that have dispersed from Australia. Overall, our observations demonstrate that the genus Ninox is likely to have colonised the Wallacean region multiple times as small, low-lying islands undergo frequent extinction, whereas populations on large and high-altitude islands are more resilient.

For species delimitation, we chose an integrative approach, combining morphological and bioacoustic data and DNA barcoding (mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene). We identified three species using independent evidence from the three different data sets: Ptychadena anchietae, Ptychadena porosissima, and a species of the Ptychadena mascareniensis group. The latter is undistinguishable genetically, bioacoustically, and morphologically from populations from Uganda, Kenya, and Egypt. We resurrect the name Ptychadena nitotica for these populations. The species differs strongly genetically from topotypic P. mascareniensis, and from clades referred to as P. cf. mascareniensis from Western and Central Africa. Morphologically, the three Rwandan species can be differentiated by their quantitative morphometrics (discriminant analysis, success rate: 98.3\%) and by a number of qualitative characters of external morphology which are useful for identification in the field. The specific features of the advertisement call differ unequivocally among the three species and allow detection and identification in the field. We also provide quantitative descriptions of temporal and frequency structure of the release calls of two of the species and the distress calls of all three species. Finally, we compare the 16S sequences obtained from Rwandan specimens with those deposited in GenBank to estimate geographical distribution of taxa in Africa.

In this study, we investigated the presence and distribution of golden jackals in northern Bosnia and Herzegovina, where knowledge about golden jackal distribution and habitat use is still scarce. We used bioacoustic stimulation as a non-invasive tool to gather data on golden jackal presence. Habitat structures potentially selected by the species were assessed at 92 calling stations and used as input for binary logistic regression models. Our study area covered approximately 1150 km(2), and bioacoustic stimulation within this area resulted in an estimated minimum relative group density of 3.5 territorial groups per 100 km(2). We found territorial groups at distances between 15 and 38 km southwards from the river Sava but always within a maximum range of 3 km to perennial watercourses. Habitat analysis identified shrub vegetation and pastures as structures with a significant effect on the presence of resident golden jackals. Probability that golden jackals answered at calling stations increased with increasing surface area covered with pastures and shrubs. Distances between golden jackal territories and the nearest human settlement were relatively small. Our results indicate that structures like transitional woodland-shrubs and pastures, together with other potential influencing factors like local agricultural practices, low hunting pressure, diverse natural and anthropogenic food sources, could have benefited the settlement of golden jackals in the northern lowlands of Bosnia and Herzegovina.",Bioacoustic stimulation;CORINE land cover;GIS;Habitat analysis,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,2021,FEB,Article,English,Ecology;Zoology
10.1007/s10336-019-01649-8,Comparison between lek counts and bioacoustic recording for monitoring Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L.),"Abrahams,Carlos",Nottingham Trent University,"Bioacoustics is the study of animal sounds. The importance of bioacoustics for biological research andthe survey and monitoring of bird populations is becoming increasingly recognized. This is particularly the case for the capture of long-term data on rare species that are prone to disturbance or are otherwise difficult to survey. The global population of the Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L.; hereafter Capercaillie') is declining, and its status in the UK is highly precarious. Current methods for monitoring this species are subject to a number of constraints that affect the quality of collected data. Bioacoustics could provide a useful complement to these existing methods, in particular for the assessment of activity at leks. This study used acoustic recorders to survey Capercaillie vocal activity for a month at ten lek sites, and quantified the numbers of calls produced. Traditional lek count surveys were undertaken at all sites during this time. The recorded vocal activity data (1) correlated with the number of birds recorded by human surveyors, (2) indicated that traditional surveys may be causing some disturbance at the lek sites, and (3) showed that call numbers are related to temporal and environmental variables. The bioacoustic approach can provide high-quality, long-term data, that can be effectively combined with the traditional lek survey technique. It should be utilized more frequently as a survey and monitoring tool to provide structured, coherent results that can be used to aid conservation efforts. ZusammenfassungVergleich zwischen Balzplatzzahlungen und bioakustischen Aufnahmen beim Monitoring des Auerhuhns (Tetrao urogallus L.)Die Bioakustik befasst sich mit der Untersuchung von Tierstimmen und deren Nutzen fur die biologische Forschung. Sie gewinnt zunehmend an Anerkennung bei der Erfassung und dem Monitoring von Vogelpopulationen. Dies ist vor allem der Fall bei der Erhebung von Langzeitdaten zu seltenen Arten, welche storungsanfallig oder auf andere Weise schwer zu erfassen sind. Die globale Population des Auerhuhns (Tetrao urogallus L.) nimmt ab und ist vor allem im Vereinigten Konigreich in einer hochst prekaren Lage. Aktuelle Methoden beim Monitoring von Arten unterliegen zahlreichen Einschrankungen, welche die Qualitat der gesammelten Daten beeinflussen. Die Bioakustik konnte eine nutzvolle Erganzung oder Alternative zu diesen existierenden Methoden bieten, vor allem bei der Beurteilung von Aktivitaten an den Balzplatzen. Diese Studie verwendete akustische Aufnahmegerate, um die Rufaktivitat des Auerhuhns fur einen Monat an zehn Balzplatzen zu untersuchen und die abgegebene Anzahl an Rufen zu quantifizieren. An allen Platzen wurden wahrend dieser Zeit zusatzlich traditionelle Balzplatzzahlungen durchgefuhrt. Die aufgenommenen Rufaktivitatsdaten (i) korrelierten mit der Anzahl an Vogeln, die von den Beobachtern selber erfasst wurden, (ii) deuteten darauf hin, dass traditionelle Zahlungen mit gro ss er Wahrscheinlichkeit Storungen an den Balzplatzen verursachen und (iii) zeigten, dass die Rufanzahl in Zusammenhang mit Umweltvariablen steht. Der bioakustische Untersuchungsansatz bietet (neben anderen Vorteilen) Daten mit besserer Qualitat, uber einen langeren Zeitraum und mit einem geringeren Ressourcenbedarf als die traditionellen Verfahren der Balzplatzzahlung.

Large volumes of acoustic data can be collected autonomously and remotely with minimal human effort. The approach is commonly used to detect cryptic species and, more recently, to estimate abundance or density. However, the potential for conservationrelevant information to be derived from acoustic signatures associated with particular behavior is less well-exploited. Animal vocal behavior can reveal important information about critical life history events. In this study, we argue that the overlap of the disciplines of bioacoustics, vocal communication, and conservation behavior-thus, ``acoustic conservation behavior{''}-has much to offer threatened species monitoring. In particular, vocalizations can serve as indicators of behavioral states and contexts that provide insight into populations as it relates to their conservation. We explore the information available from monitoring species' vocalizations that relate to reproduction and recruitment, alarm and defense, and social behavior, and how this information could translate into potential conservation benefits. While there are still challenges to processing acoustic data, we conclude that acoustic conservation behavior may improve threatened species monitoring where vocalizations reveal behaviors that are informative for management and decision-making.",bioacoustics;conservation behavior;monitoring;vocal behavior;vocalizations,CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE,2019,AUG,Review,English,Biodiversity Conservation

Bioacoustic studies differ from traditional field surveys that are often more visual and require work in the daytime. A sampling of acoustic signals is possible to explore the diurnal variation of the forest ecosystem. Normalized difference soundscape index (NDSI), acoustic diversity index (ADI), and power spectral density (PSD) were chosen as acoustic indices to quantify the dominance, diversity, and composition of the biophony of forest settings. Biophony was recorded in ten south subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest sites in Shenzhen, China. Composition structure (species richness), horizontal structure (vegetation density and canopy cover), and vertical structure (tree height diversity and each layer height) were used to evaluate the structure of vegetation. Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were applied to examine the effects of different vegetation structures on biophony between day and night. The relationships between various biophonic frequency bands and vegetation structural variables during day and night were estimated by redundancy analysis (RDA). Results showed that different sound frequencies and vocalization behavior of vocalizing species determine the variance between the forest sound environment during day and night. Forest canopy and understory have a significant influence on biophonic diversity and dominance separately. The vocalizing species' preferences for different habitats were affected by the same vegetation structure variables across diurnal variation. Canopy cover and understory species richness had a significant positive effect on low-frequency biophony, and tree height diversity was found to have a significant positive impact on high-frequency biophony. Finally, tree height diversity was the core variable in the forest acoustic environment, and higher tree height diversity resulted in a more dominant and diverse biophony. This study shows the potential of bioacoustic methods to reveal the day-night dynamics of vocalizing species, using easily measured acoustic variables that can help with the timely evaluation of potential impacts of vegetation structure on forest animal communities.",Acoustic community;Bioacoustic;Forest ecology;Soundscape;Urban forests;Vegetation structure,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,2021,FEB 15,Article,English,Forestry

This paper presents an application of deep learning for acoustic event detection in a challenging, data-scarce, real-world problem. We show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs), operating on wavelet transformations of audio recordings, demonstrate superior performance over conventional classifiers that utilize handcrafted features. Our key result is that wavelet transformations offer a clear benefit over the more commonly used short-time Fourier transform. Furthermore, we show that features, handcrafted for a particular dataset, do not generalize well to other datasets. Conversely, CNNs trained on generic features are able to achieve comparable results across multiple datasets, along with outperforming human labellers.

For genetic monitoring of golden jackals via scat collection, the distinction of jackal scats from those of related species such as the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is crucial: if done incorrectly, it can falsify diet studies or inflate costs of DNA analyses. In this study, we tested the potential benefits of using domestic dogs to specifically find jackal scats. We used trained scat detection dogs to locate and identify golden jackal scats in an area of dense shrubland, with the species' presence previously confirmed via bioacoustic monitoring. On a total of 133 km of transects covering at least two golden jackal groups, two human-dog teams found 34 putative golden jackal scats.

Our results show that detection dogs can successfully differentiate golden jackal scats from other species. This tool can be applied to detect golden jackal presence and establish more reliable estimates of group number and size than previously determined through bioacoustic stimulation. By combining both methods, questions about family structures and kinship, seasonal differences in habitat use and territory sizes can be answered.

For bats, acoustic surveys have long been known to complement traditional mist-netting, however, appropriate protocol guidelines are still lacking for tropical regions. Establishing the minimum sampling effort needed to detect ecological changes in bat assemblages (e.g., activity, composition, and richness) is crucial in view of workload and project cost constraints, and because detecting such changes must be reliable enough to support effective conservation management. Using one of the most comprehensive tropical bat acoustic data sets, collected in the Amazon, we assessed the minimum survey effort required to accurately assess the completeness of assemblage inventories and habitat selection in fragmented forest landscapes for aerial insectivorous bats. We evaluated a combination of 20 different temporal sampling schemes, which differed regarding number of hours per night, number of nights per site, and sampling only during the wet or dry season, or both. This was assessed under two different landscape scenarios: in primary forest fragments embedded in a matrix of secondary forest and in the same forest fragments, but after they had been re-isolated through clearing of the secondary forest. We found that the sampling effort required to achieve 90\% inventory completeness varied considerably depending on the research aim and the landscape scenario evaluated, averaging similar to 80 and 10 nights before and after fragment re-isolation, respectively. Recording for more than 4 h per night did not result in a substantial reduction in the required number of sampling nights. Regarding the effects of habitat selection, except for assemblage composition, bat responses in terms of richness, diversity, and activity were similar across all sampling schemes after fragment re-isolation. However, before re-isolation, a minimum of four to six sampling hours per night after dusk and three to five nights of sampling per site were needed to detect significant effects that could otherwise go unnoticed.

One component of this call is the D note, which is a low-frequency and acoustically complex note with a harmonic-like structure. In the current study, we tested black-capped chickadees on a between-category operant discrimination task using vocalizations with acoustic structures similar to black-capped chickadee D notes, but produced by various songbird species, in order to examine the role that phylogenetic distance plays in acoustic perception of vocal signals. We assessed the extent to which discrimination performance was influenced by the phylogenetic relatedness among the species producing the vocalizations and by the phylogenetic relatedness between the subjects' species (black-capped chickadees) and the vocalizers' species. We also conducted a bioacoustic analysis and discriminant function analysis in order to examine the acoustic similarities among the discrimination stimuli. A previous study has shown that neural activation in black-capped chickadee auditory and perceptual brain regions is similar following the presentation of these vocalization categories. However, we found that chickadees had difficulty discriminating between forward and reversed black-capped chickadee D notes, a result that directly corresponded to the bioacoustic analysis indicating that these stimulus categories were acoustically similar. In addition, our results suggest that the discrimination between vocalizations produced by two parid species (chestnut-backed chickadees and tufted titmice) is perceptually difficult for black-capped chickadees, a finding that is likely in part because these vocalizations contain acoustic similarities. Overall, our results provide evidence that black-capped chickadees' perceptual abilities are influenced by both phylogenetic relatedness and acoustic structure.",Acoustic discrimination;Bioacoustic analysis;Black-capped chickadee;Categorization;Operant conditioning;Songbird,ANIMAL COGNITION,2017,JUL,Article,English,Behavioral Sciences;Zoology

The faunal vocalisations captured by these sensors can answer ecological questions, however, identifying these vocalisations within recorded audio is difficult: automatic recognition is currently intractable and manual recognition is slow and error prone. In this paper, a semi-automated approach to call recognition is presented. An automated decision support tool is tested that assists users in the manual annotation process. The respective strengths of human and computer analysis are used to complement one another. The tool recommends the species of an unknown vocalisation and thereby minimises the need for the memorization of a large corpus of vocalisations. In the case of a folksonomic tagging system, recommending species tags also minimises the proliferation of redundant tag categories. We describe two algorithms: (1) a ``naive{''} decision support tool (16\%-64\% sensitivity) with efficiency of O(n) but which becomes unscalable as more data is added and (2) a scalable alternative with 48\% sensitivity and an efficiency of O(log n). The improved algorithm was also tested in a HTML-based annotation prototype. The result of this work is a decision support tool for annotating faunal acoustic events that may be utilised by other bioacoustics projects.

By analyzing the wolf howls, we focused on identifying individual wolves, subspecies. We analyzed 170 howls from 16 individuals from the three subspecies: Arctic wolves (Canis lupus arctos), Eurasian wolves (C.l. lupus), and Northwestern wolves (C.l. occidentalis). We assessed the potential for individual recognition and recognition of three subspecies: Arctic, Eurasian, and Northwestern wolves. Wolves (Canis lupus) are generally monitored by visual observations, camera traps, and DNA traces. In this study, we evaluated acoustic monitoring of wolf howls as a method for monitoring wolves, which may permit detection of wolves across longer distances than that permitted by camera traps. We analyzed acoustic data of wolves' howls collected from both wild and captive ones. The analysis focused on individual and subspecies recognition. Furthermore, we aimed to determine the usefulness of acoustic monitoring in the field given the limited data for Eurasian wolves. We analyzed 170 howls from 16 individual wolves from 3 subspecies: Arctic (Canis lupus arctos), Eurasian (C. l. lupus), and Northwestern wolves (C. l. occidentalis). Variables from the fundamental frequency (f0) (lowest frequency band of a sound signal) were extracted and used in discriminant analysis, classification matrix, and pairwise post-hoc Hotelling test. The results indicated that Arctic and Eurasian wolves had subspecies identifiable calls, while Northwestern wolves did not, though this sample size was small. Identification on an individual level was successful for all subspecies. Individuals were correctly classified with 80\%-100\% accuracy, using discriminant function analysis. Our findings suggest acoustic monitoring could be a valuable and cost-effective tool that complements camera traps, by improving long-distance detection of wolves.",bioacoustics;Canis lupus;discriminant analysis;habitats directive;monitoring;fundamental frequency;acoustic variables,ANIMALS,2022,MAR,Article,English,"Agriculture, Dairy \& Animal Science;Veterinary Sciences;Zoology"

Resident golden jackal groups can successfully be detected by active bioacoustic stimulation, as well as with passive recording devices. For monitoring, basic knowledge of the calls of the focal species and potential restrictions and strengths of the monitoring devices should be considered. We therefore tested possible applications of a low-budget autonomous recording unit for bioacoustic golden jackal monitoring and examined the following research questions: How far can group calls be detected? Can the distance to the recording device be estimated? To answer these questions, we placed 11 AudioMoth recording devices in a linear transect to record live imitated and replayed howls. For the estimation of the number of responding animals, the number of howling individuals was determined based on the maximum number of simultaneously visible fundamental frequencies in a spectrogram. To predict the distance of the playback howls to the recording devices, the relative sound level (RSL) of each call was measured and fitted in linear models. Reliable distance estimations using RSL were possible up to 400 m. Estimated number of responding animals showed a negative relationship with distance. Our results present a baseline for future studies and show that AudioMoths can be a helpful asset in distance estimation of golden jackal packs-both in passive but also active monitoring.",Canidae;Distance estimation;AudioMoth;Relative sound level;Bioacoustic monitoring;Autonomous recording units,MAMMAL RESEARCH,2021,OCT,Article,English,Zoology

They are often the sole native island mammals and play key roles in the maintenance of insular ecosystems. Yet, due to increasing anthropogenic pressures, ca. 60\% of island-restricted bats are now threatened. The sub-tropical island of Madeira is home to the Macaronesian endemic Pipistrellus maderensis, to Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus - an endemic subspecies to Madeira - and Plecotus austriacus. These species each represent the three main foraging guilds of insectivorous bats namely, edge space foragers, open space foragers and narrow space foragers. Despite the great conservation value and potential to provide pest suppression services, little is known about the habitat associations of Macaronesian bats. We used low-cost autonomous sensors to conduct an island-wide bioacoustic survey to investigate how Madeiran bats are affected by human-induced land-use change and orography. Overall we obtained >63,000 bat passes across 216 sites and at each site, we quantified land-use cover and altitude within a radius of 250, 500 and 1000 m. Pipistrellus maderensis was the most widespread and commonly recorded species, whereas Plecotus austriacus had the most restricted distribution and lowest number of detected bat passes. We found species-specific and scale-dependent responses to land-use cover, with the activity of Pipistrellus maderensis being positively associated with landscape-scale shrubland, cropland and Laurisilva (primary forest) cover, whereas the activity of Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus and Plecotus austriacus were negatively influenced by Laurisilva and cropland cover, respectively. Furthermore, we found that altitude had a negative effect on the activity of Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus and Plecotus austriacus. This study provides the first insights into the effects of land-use type on Madeiran bats and showcases the great potential of low-cost bioacoustic detectors for island-wide bat surveys.",Bioacoustic detectors;Chiroptera;Island bats;Landscape composition;Macaronesia;Madeira Island,JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION,2022,JUN,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology

Analysis of 1391 base pairs of two mitochondrial genes (COI and ND1) and one nuclear sequence (ITS2) was conducted. Phylogenetic topologies were estimated using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and likelihood-based Bayesian inference. The genus Odontura is a phylogenetic outlier in respect of all other European Phaneropterinae genera and has been proposed to have originated from a hitherto unknown ancestor. Our results support the monophyly of the genus Odontura and the recognition of two subgenera: Odontura and Odonturella. We found that both Sicilian taxa of the subgenus Odontura have a completely identical morphology and song patterns. Combining these results, we proposed that both should be treated as subspecies: O. (Odontura) stenoxypha stenoxypha and O. (O.) st.arcuata. Bioacoustic data also proved to support independent markers, with song characteristics reflecting the molecular topology. Mapping the karyotypic characters onto the phylogenetic tree allows a reconstruction of the directions and transitional stages of chromosome differentiation. The number of autosomes within the genus Odontura ranges from 26 to 30.

Call features represent an important character to discriminate species, and sound emissions are very effective to assure or reinforce genetic incompatibility, especially in the case of sibling species. Since frogs are ectotherms, acoustic properties of their calls will vary with temperature. In this study, we described the advertisement call of C. cranwelli, quantifying the temperature effect on its components. The acoustic emissions were recorded during 2007 using a DAT record Sony (TM) TCD-100 with stereo microphone ECM-MS907 Sony (TM) and tape TDK (TM) DAT-RGX 60. As males emit their calls floating in temporary ponds, water temperatures were registered after recording the advertisement calls with a digital thermometer TES 1 300 +/- 0.1 degrees C. Altogether, 54 calls from 18 males were analyzed. The temporal variables of each advertisement call were measured using oscillograms and sonograms and the analyses of dominant frequency were performed using a spectrogram. Multiple correlation analysis was used to identify the temperature-dependent acoustic variables and the temperature effect on these variables was quantified using linear regression models. The advertisement call of C. cranwelli consists of a single pulse group. Call duration, Pulse duration and Pulse interval decreased with the temperature, whereas the Pulse rate increased with temperature. The temperature-dependent variables were standardized at 25 degrees C according to the linear regression model obtained. The acoustic variables that were correlated with the temperature are the variables which emissions depend on laryngeal muscles and the temperature constraints the contractile properties of muscles. Our results indicated that temperature explains an important fraction of the variability in some acoustic variables (79\% in the Pulse rate), and demonstrated the importance of considering the effect of temperature in acoustic components. The results suggest that acoustic variables show geographic variation to compare data with previous works.",Ceratophrys cranwelli;bioacoustics;temperature effects;ethology,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,2013,MAR,Article,Spanish,Biology

In this work, we assess several new entropy measures including the recently developed Permutation Entropy, Weighted Permutation Entropy, and Permutation Min-Entropy, and compare them to the classical Energy, Zero Crossing Rate and Spectral Entropy. In addition, we propose an algorithm to estimate the optimal segmentation threshold value used to separate deterministic segments from stochastic ones avoiding the creation of thin clusters. To assess the performance of our segmentation approach, we applied a frame-by-frame, a point-to-point and an event-to event comparisons. We show that in a scenario with severe noise conditions (SNR <= 0dB), simple entropy descriptors are robust, achieving 97\% of segmentation performance, while keeping a low computational cost. We conclude that there is no LLD that is suitable for all scenarios, and we must adopt multiple or different LLDs, depending on the expected noise conditions.

A recent UK conservation dilemma has centred on the status of the pool frog Rana lessonae. This species has been the subject of documented introductions from central and southern Europe since the early 1800s, the accepted position being that all UK R. lessonae populations are descended from these introductions. However, a closer examination of early UK literature sources, and recent discoveries of isolated, native R. lessonae populations in Sweden and Norway, led some herpetologists to question whether the species was in fact present as a native at some locations prior to the introductions. Research was initiated along four major lines of enquiry: genetic, bioacoustic, archaeozoological and archival. A high degree of convergence among the genetic and bioacoustic investigations demonstrated that the potentially native UK pool frogs were closely related to Scandinavian frogs, thus ruling out introductions from further south as a potential origin. Subfossil evidence of pool frogs was found from ca. 1000 years before present, demonstrating that the species occurred in the UK prior to known introductions. Archival sources produced no historical support for introductions from northern Europe. The postglacial history inferred for these northern populations is consistent with the known climatic and geographical conditions. Taken together, the evidence for the native status of the pool frog is compelling, and furthermore the UK population appears to be part of a distinct northern clade.",archaeozoology;bioacoustic analysis;introduced species;literature;microsatellites;native species;randomly amplified polymorphic DNA;ranidae,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,2005,JUN,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology;Environmental Sciences

Preprocessing is typically made up of multiple steps which are considered separately from each other. These are often resource intensive, particularly because the volume of data involved is high. We focus on addressing two challenges within this problem: how to combine existing preprocessing tasks while maximising the effectiveness of each step, and how to process this pipeline quickly and efficiently, so that it can be used to process high volumes of acoustic data. We describe a distributed system designed specifically for this problem, utilising a master-slave model with data parallelisation. By investigating the impact of individual preprocessing tasks on each other, and their execution times, we determine an efficient and accurate order for preprocessing tasks within the distributed system. We find that, using a single core, our pipeline executes 1.40 times faster compared to manually executing all preprocessing tasks. We then apply our pipeline in the distributed system and evaluate its performance. We find that our system is capable of preprocessing bird acoustic recordings at a rate of 174.8 seconds of audio per second of real time with 32 cores over 8 virtual machines, which is 21.76 times faster than a serial process.",,PLOS ONE,2018,AUG 3,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

The populations of Thrace and of the island of Samothraki form a group giving the same type of mating call, whereas the mating call of the other populations differs in the degree of temperature dependence of four parameters, and specifically in the number of pulses/pulse group and pulse groups/call. Discriminant functions distinguish even single call series with a probability of 97 \%, intermediate mating calls are absent, and there is a significant, but slight differentiation of external morphological characters.

Moreover, the patterned hiPSC-CMs within the constructs exhibit significantly greater levels of contractile stress, beat frequency, and contraction-relaxation rates, suggesting their improved maturation. Our results demonstrate a novel application of Faraday waves to create stem cell-derived 3D cardiac tissue that resembles the cellular architecture of a native heart tissue for diverse basic research and clinical applications.

Here, we investigate these issues using winter wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes), an unusual example of a passerine with a Holarctic distribution. Geographical variation has led to speculation that the western North American form Troglodytes troglodytes pacificus might be a distinct biological species compared to those in eastern North America (e.g. Troglodytes troglodytes hiemalis) and Eurasia. We located the first known area in which both forms can be found, often inhabiting neighbouring territories. Each male wren in this area sings either western or eastern song, and the differences in song are as distinct in the contact zone as they are in allopatry. The two singing types differ distinctly in mitochondrial DNA sequences and amplified fragment length polymorpism profiles. These results indicate that the two forms are reproductively isolated to a high degree where they co-occur and are therefore separate species. DNA variation suggests that the initial split between the two species occurred before the Pleistocene, quite long ago for sister species in the boreal forest. Surprisingly, the two forms are similar in morphometric traits and habitat characteristics of territories. These findings suggest that sexual selection played a larger role than habitat divergence in generating reproductive isolation, and raise the possibility that there are other such morphologically cryptic species pairs in North America.",AFLP;cryptic species;mitochondrial DNA;pacific wren;Troglodytes troglodytes;winter wren,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2008,JUN,Article,English,Biochemistry \& Molecular Biology;Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

A phylogeny inferred from DNA sequences of multiple mitochondrial and nuclear genes, with representatives of all cophyline genera except Madecassophryne and including representatives of the two most divergent intrageneric lineages within Cophyla, placed Cophyla as sister group of Platypelis and confirmed both genera as reciprocally monophyletic. We describe three new Cophyla species based on osteological, morphological and bioacoustic characters as well as genetic differentiation in one nuclear and several mitochondrial markers. As in the vast majority of cophylines, all species of Cophyla emit long, stereotyped repetitions of a single tonal note, and we here consider one of these notes as a call; call duration thus equals note duration and the intervals between calls are named inter-call intervals. Cophyla maharipeo sp. nov. collected in Joffreville and Foret d'Ambre Special Reserve (adult SVL 22-27 mm) is characterized by having long calls (1166-1346 ms) with long inter-call intervals (2154-3881 ms). Cophyla noromalalae sp. nov. collected in Montagne d'Ambre National Park (adult SVL 22-29 mm) is characterized by having short calls (662-821 ms) and short inter-call intervals (874-1882 ms). Cophyla puellarum sp. nov., also from Montagne d'Ambre National Park, is larger than the other two species (adult SVL 27.3-33.6 mm) and characterized by the shortest calls (326-390 ms) and long inter-call intervals (1961-3996 ms). Osteological analyses based on micro-CT scans and cleared and stained specimens confirms that the shape of the posterior vomer (centrally divided vs. undivided) may be a useful character to diagnose most species as belonging to either Platypelis and Cophyla, and suggest the absence of clavicles (present in Platypelis) is a derived character of most Cophyla. However, clavicles were present in C. puellarum, the only known Cophyla occurring at relatively high elevations (1250-1300 m a.s.l.) while otherwise in northern Madagascar, forests at higher elevations up to 2700 m a.s.l. are occupied by Platypelis species. Cophyla maharipeo was found at relatively low elevations (630-720 m a.s.l.), similar to the three previously known congeners (C. berara, C. occultans, C. phyllodactyla). Cophyla noromalalae occurs at intermediate elevations (900-1050 m a.s.l.). The molecular phylogeny inferred herein suggests that the ancestor of a clade containing all Cophyla species except C. puellarum evolved a modified shoulder girdle structure without ossified clavicles, and adapted to low-elevation habitats.",Amphibia;Anura;Microhylidae;Platypelis;conservation status;integrative taxonomy;Montagne d'Ambre;micro-CT scanning,ZOOTAXA,2015,MAR 24,Article,English,Zoology

This is particularly true for monitoring nocturnal bird migration, where automated classification of migrants' flight calls could yield new biological insights and conservation applications for birds that vocalize during migration. In this paper we investigate the automatic classification of bird species from flight calls, and in particular the relationship between two different problem formulations commonly found in the literature: classifying a short clip containing one of a fixed set of known species (N-class problem) and the continuous monitoring problem, the latter of which is relevant to migration monitoring. We implemented a state-of-the-art audio classification model based on unsupervised feature learning and evaluated it on three novel datasets, one for studying the N-class problem including over 5000 flight calls from 43 different species, and two realistic datasets for studying the monitoring scenario comprising hundreds of thousands of audio clips that were compiled by means of remote acoustic sensors deployed in the field during two migration seasons. We show that the model achieves high accuracy when classifying a clip to one of N known species, even for a large number of species. In contrast, the model does not perform as well in the continuous monitoring case. Through a detailed error analysis (that included full expert review of false positives and negatives) we show the model is confounded by varying background noise conditions and previously unseen vocalizations. We also show that the model needs to be parameterized and benchmarked differently for the continuous monitoring scenario. Finally, we show that despite the reduced performance, given the right conditions the model can still characterize the migration pattern of a specific species.

However, the processing of such data is currently limited by the ability to efficiently and reliably detect the target sounds, which are often sparse and overshadowed by environmental noise. This paper proposes a sound detector based on changepoint theory applied to a wavelet representation of the sound. In contrast to existing methods, in this framework, theoretical analysis of the detector's performance and optimality for downstream applications can be made. The relevant statistical and algorithmic developments to support these claims are presented. The method is then tested on a real task of detecting two bird species in acoustic surveys. Compared to commonly used alternatives, the proposed method consistently produced a lower false alarm rate and improved the survey efficiency as measured by the precision of the inferred population size. Finally, it is demonstrated how the method can be combined with a simple classifier to detect cat sounds in domestic recordings, which is an example from the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2018 workshop. The resulting performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art deep learning models and requires much less training data.

,Anuran diversity of cultivated wetlands in Rwanda: melting pot of generalists?,"Tumushimire,Lambert;Mindje,Mapendo;Sinsch,Ulrich;Dehling,J.Maximilian",University of Rwanda;University of Rwanda;University of Koblenz \& Landau,"Since 2009 we surveyed anuran communities of two cultivated valley-bottom wetlands ({''}marais{''}) at approximately 1,600 m a.s.l. (Rugeramigozi and Butare wetland, Rwanda) to determine species richness and composition after decades of crop production. For the assessment of species presence and abundance, we used standardised bioacoustic recordings of male anurans advertising in a given microhabitat type complemented with visual species detection and identification. We hypothesize that present-day anuran communities in cultivated marais do not reflect the historical association to gallery forests, but represent assemblages of disturbance-tolerant species, ie. a melting pot of habitat generalists. In fact, microhabitat diversity and species composition were similar at the two study sites and the 13 species detected in the Rugeramigozi wetland were also present among the 17 species detected in the Butare wetland. With the exception of two ubiquist species, none of the species showed a forest-association. Species richness of cultivated valley-bottom wetlands is about a third of total richness in Rwanda and outnumbered that of natural habitats about twofold. We conclude that high species richness and homogeneous species composition is the result of the specific landscape configuration of wetland belts connected over hundreds of kilometres allowing for uninterrupted dispersal along these corridors. Therefore, all species capable of exploiting these habitats could reach any point of the wetland network, i.e. similar-structured cultivated wetlands represent a melting pot of mainly generalist species.",Amphibia;Anura;bioacoustic and visual species detection;advertisement call activity;cultivated wetlands;microhabitat diversity;Afrotropics,SALAMANDRA,2020,MAY 15,Article,English,Marine \& Freshwater Biology;Zoology

With climate change occurring at an accelerated rate at high latitudes, we expect changes in the timing of the onset of spring to impact the timing of wood frog breeding. Wood frogs in the subarctic emerge from hibernation just after the snow melts and ambient air temperatures increase, but local and regional drivers of breeding phenology are not well understood and are difficult to study due to the relative inaccessibility of the region. We deployed passive acoustic monitors at multiple sites from 2011 to 2017 to track the timing of wood frog breeding based on calling activity and determine how this activity relates to environmental conditions. We developed a semi-automated approach for detecting wood frog calls, including the manual removal of false positives, and show that these estimates of activity are closely related to the timing of snowmelt and ambient air temperature. Our results suggest that wood frog breeding phenology in subarctic and arctic ecosystems will likely change in response to warming conditions, and we conclude that passive acoustic monitoring paired with semi-automated detection of wood frog calling provides an accurate and efficient method for tracking changes in population-scale wood frog breeding in this challenging and rapidly changing ecosystem.",Passive acoustic monitoring;Wood frog;Breeding phenology;Automated acoustic detection;Spring phenology;Arctic;Subarctic,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2021,NOV,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Environmental Sciences

To determine whether this bioacoustic effect was caused by ultrasonic-induced changes in the biofilm morphology (biofilm breakup or disruption), the biofilms were examined by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). Such disruption would be undesirable in the possible ultrasonic treatment of implant infections. The CSLM results showed that the biofilm is a partial monolayer of cells with occasional aggregates of cells, non-cellular materials and extracellular spaces. The aggregates contained large amounts of exopolysaccharide. The structure of biofilm was not changed when the biofilm was exposed to continuous ultrasound at 500 k Hz and 10 mWcm(-2), the same irradiation parameters that increased cell killing by nearly two orders of magnitude. The observation that low-intensity ultrasound does not disrupt biofilm or disperse the bacteria has significance in the possible use of ultrasound to enhance the action of antibiotics against biofilms.

Alarm calls of 96 individuals from 13 localities (from the Sea of Azov to Karakum adjacent to the Aral Sea) were analyzed. Parameters of polynomial equations were used as variables for the characterization of frequency modulations of the signal. The cluster and principal component analyses have revealed a significant level of distinctions between S. pygmaeus dwelling in the territories to the east and west from the Volga River. The possibility of contacts between populations inhabiting the both river banks was shown. The presence of breaks in the signal variability between the populations appears to be a consequence of isolation in refuges during the Quaternary period. The close similarity of the sound signal in S. musicus and S. pygmaeus (inhabiting to the west from the Volga) allows us to consider S. musicus as a subspecies of Spermophilus pygmaeus Musicus.,,ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL,2007,NOV,Article,Russian,Zoology

To test the ability of a microphone recording system, located distal to the respiratory outflow tract, to track the timing of the inspiratory and expiratory phases of breathing in awake healthy subjects. Methods. Fifteen subjects participated. Breath sounds were recorded using a microphone embedded in a face frame in a fixed location in relation to the nostrils and mouth, while simultaneously recording respiratory movements by respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP). Subjects were studied while supine and were instructed to breathe normally for 2 min: through their noses only (nasal breathing), during the first min, and through their mouths only (oral breathing) during the second min. Five subjects (test group) were chosen randomly to extract features from their acoustic data. Ten breaths (5 nasal and 5 oral breaths) from each subject were studied. Inspiratory and expiratory segments of breath sounds were determined and extracted from the acoustic data by comparing it to the RIP trace. Subsequently, the frequency spectrum of each phase was then determined. Spectral variables derived from the 5 test subjects were applied prospectively to detect breathing phases in the remaining 10 subjects (validation group). Results. Test group data showed that the mean of all inspiratory spectra peaked between 30 and 270 Hz, flattened between 300 and 1,100 Hz, and peaked again with a center frequency of 1,400 Hz. The expiratory spectra peaked between 30 and 180 Hz and its power dropped off exponentially after that. Accordingly, the bands ratio (BR) of frequency magnitudes between 500 and 2500 Hz to frequency magnitudes between 0 and 500 Hz was chosen as a feature to distinguish between breathing phases. BR for the mean inspiratory spectrum was 2.27 and for the mean expiratory spectrum was 0.15. The route of breathing did not affect the BR ratio within the same phase. When this BR was applied to 436 breathing phases in the validation group, 424 (97\%) were correctly identified (Kappa = 0.96, P< 0.001) indicating strong agreement between the acoustic method and the RIP. Conclusion. Frequency spectra of breathing sounds recorded from a face-frame, reliably identified the inspiratory and expiratory phases of breathing.

Variations in the recording devices, environmental conditions, and the presence of vocalizations from other animals make the bird sound detection very challenging. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an unsupervised algorithm comprising two main stages. In the first stage, a spectrogram enhancement technique is proposed using a multiple window Savitzky-Golay (MWSG) filter. We show that the spectrogram estimate using MWSG filter is unbiased and has lower variance compared with its single window counterpart. It is known that bird sounds are highly structured in the time-frequency (T-F) plane. We exploit these cues of prominence of T-F activity in specific directions from the enhanced spectrogram, in the second stage of the proposed method, for bird sound detection. In this regard, we use a set of four moving average filters that when applied to the enhanced spectrogram, yield directional spectrograms that capture the direction specific information. We propose a thresholding scheme on the time varying energy profile computed from each of these directional spectrograms to obtain frame-level binary decisions of bird sound activity. These individual decisions are then combined to obtain the final decision. Experiments are performed with three different datasets, with varying recording and noise conditions. Frame level F-score is used as the evaluation metric for bird sound detection. We find that the proposed method, on average, achieves higher F-score (10.24\% relative) compared to the best of the six baseline schemes considered in this work.",Bioacoustic monitoring;bird sound detection;directional spectrograms;Savitzky-Golay filter,IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING,2017,JUN,Article,English,"Acoustics;Engineering, Electrical \& Electronic"

Acoustic analyses have been used to investigate the influence of factors such as individuality, context, sex, age, and size on variation in calls. More recent studies have expanded our knowledge on the effects of phylogenetic relatedness and the structure of primate vocal repertoires in general. Complementary playback experiments allow direct testing of hypotheses regarding the attribution of meaning to calls, the cognitive mechanisms underpinning responses, and/or the adaptive value of primate behavior. After briefly touching on the historical background of this field of research, we first provide an introduction to recording primate vocalizations and discuss different approaches to describe primate calls in terms of their temporal and spectral properties. Second, we present a tutorial regarding the preparation, execution, and interpretation of field playback experiments, including a review of studies that have used such approaches to investigate the responses to acoustic variation in calls including the integration of contextual and acoustic information, recognition of kin and social relationships, and social knowledge. Based on the review of the literature and our own experience, we make a number of recommendations regarding the most common problems and pitfalls. The power of acoustic analyses typically hinges on the quality of the recordings and the number of individuals represented in the sample. Playback experiments require profound knowledge of the natural behavior of the animals for solid interpretation; experiments should be conducted sparingly, to avoid habituation of the subjects to the occurrence of the calls; experimenter-blind designs chosen whenever possible; and researchers should brace themselves for long periods of waiting times until the appropriate moments to do the experiment arise.

In this study, the team built deep convolutional neural networks to analyze field recordings and classify calls of Yellow-vented warbler (Phylloscopus cantator) and Rufous-throated wren-babbler (Spelaeornis caudatus), both of which are regionally rare in Nepal. Data augmentation techniques for calls of the two bird species were utilized to effectively increase the size of the training set and thus boost model performance. Nepali ornithologists were engaged in iterative data labeling from field recordings, leveraging ML technology in conjunction with expert manual labeling and verification. The model output provides insights of species activity and abundance throughout 2018-2019 in multiple ecosystems along an elevational transect in the Barun River Valley, Nepal. The results of this study may help conservationists better understand species distribution, behavior, diversity, and habitat preference. Additionally, the results provide baseline data to quantify future changes due to habitat disruption or climate change.

Some tools for the protection of Killer Whales and other cetaceans are founded in the analysis of their recorded vocalizations. With this framework we are able to test every part under controlled conditions before open sea experiments. Some of these devices have been designed to localize and track open sea populations in order to facilitate data collection for conservation management. At this moment the framework consists of the basic necessary instruments and IT resources for continuously multichannel recording of vocalizations from four specimens of Killer Whale. The enormous raw data stream forces the implementation of a data reduction strategy. As a result, the present research is focused in the development of techniques for this purpose that will allow the automatic classification of events and obtain statistical data. Complementarily, our research goals are also focused on the design of prototypes for source localization using time tags of events on multiple channels for continuous real time logging of behaviour and position of specimens.

The ``absolute{''} calling effort (as absolute seconds per hour spent on calling calculated as the sum of all detected calls during one hour) was between 165 and 716 s/hour (535 191) with a peak at around 23:00 h, followed by a decrease until the end of the calling period. This might be due to vocal fatigue. In comparison with literature, the overall call production was higher than expected, but calling effort is comparable to estimates from the literature for other leptodactylid frogs.

There is less knowledge of how grazing by bison impacts grassland birds, especially in sites restored and reconstructed from row-crop agriculture. Working at a tallgrass prairie site consisting of restored and remnant prairie in the years following bison reintroduction and ongoing prescribed burning, we assessed overall species richness and the relative detection frequency of five focal species (Grasshopper Sparrow, Henslow's Sparrow, Dickcissel, Eastern Meadowlark, and Brown-headed Cowbird). We used stationary bioacoustics recorders to record the soundscape during the summer breeding season in areas with and without bison from 2016 to 2018. Species richness and the detection frequencies of our focal species were not influenced by bison disturbance. Grasshopper Sparrow and Dickcissel detection frequency increased slightly in response to prescribed fire, whereas Henslow's Sparrow detection frequency decreased. Time since sites were restored was a predominant factor that influenced the variation in detection frequency of Henslow's Sparrows and Eastern Meadowlarks, likely due to vegetation differences in restored versus remnant sites and each species' vegetation structure preferences. Brown-headed Cowbird detection frequency was unaffected by bison presence, prescribed fire, or time since restoration, but varied among sampling years. Our focal species showed no response to bison disturbance 4 y after the bison reintroduction. This suggests there could be a time-lag for a response or that these species will not respond to the bison reintroduction at this study site.",,AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST,2021,OCT,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology

The system has wide-angle overlapping peripheral fields of view with a narrow central field superposed. It is noninvasively coupled to the auditory system for neural processing and spatial imaging. Blind persons learn to comprehend the auditory cortical multiple-object image that is created. The real-time synchronous relationship between hearing a change in the sensor sounds and the sensed motor actions causing the change seems to aid the learning process. Computer based testing of the sensor system is described so as to relate the physical system performance with the time-varying human auditory perception. This is so that the basic psychometric experiments studying the sensor bio-acoustic spatial resolution, resulting from the superposition of two wide-angle peripheral fields with one central narrow field, may be better understood. These tests confirm that the auditory ability of subjects to resolve close objects using the combined fields is significantly improved relative to using the peripheral fields alone.

Consequently, there is growing demand for precautionary measures against such expansion, which is primarily associated with males during the initial stage of invasion. Therefore, the present study introduces two novel approaches passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) and active acoustic monitoring (AAM) to detect males with high sensitivity, using their howls during the rut. This study verifies the feasibility of these approaches by comparing them with existing methods based on spotlights and camera traps at five sites that support different deer densities. To validate PAM, we set unattended sound recorders to evaluate the time and variation in howl frequency at different sites. In addition, we measured the detection range of the howl. To verify AAM, we assessed whether sika deer males are vocally responsive to audio playbacks, and if so, the extent to which the frequency of the howl-back against different sound sources could explain male abundance. Both the PAM and AAM successfully detected males, even at sites with extremely low deer density where detection using existing methods failed. PAM had a detection zone of around 6 ha in defoliated forests, which was > 200-times greater than that of camera traps. The frequency of howl-back immediately after playbacks was higher than that of spontaneous howls; thus, AAM proved effective at explaining male abundance when using playbacks of real howls. In conclusion, our findings suggested that bioacoustic approaches could enhance the monitoring of low density deer populations that might be in the initial stage of deer invasion or at the stage where the target density has been reached following population control.",Bioacoustic monitoring;Camera trap;Cervus nippon;Howl;Low-density population;Spotlight count,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2017,AUG,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Environmental Sciences

However, there is no standard lung sound transducer or any device to compare transducers so that measurements from different laboratories can be determined to be of physiologic origin rather than technical artifacts of the transducers. To address this problem, we designed and constructed a prototype of a device that can be used to compare accelerometers, microphones enclosed in couplers, and stethoscopes. The prototype device consists of a rigid chamber containing a loudspeaker that opens to an antechamber covered by a viscoelastic material with mechanical properties similar to human skin and subcutaneous tissue. When driven by a white noise source, we found the sound output at the surface to be useful to comparatively evaluate sensors between 100 and 1200 Hz where lung sounds have most of their spectral energy. We compared the viscoelastic layer to similar thicknesses of fresh meat and fat and found them to produce similar acoustic spectra.

It is now possible to develop computer-based systems to achieve the same task with a number of advantages including continuous long term unattended operation and automatic species logging. The system described here achieves automated discrimination between different species by utilizing a novel time domain signal coding technique and an artificial neural network. The system has previously been shown to recognize 25 species of British Orthoptera with 99\% accuracy for good quality sounds. This paper tests the system on field recordings of four species of grasshopper in northern England in 2002 and shows that it is capable of not only correctly recognizing the target species under a range of acoustic conditions but also of recognizing other sounds such as birds and man-made sounds.

One such index, the Shannon-Weiner index (SWI), has often been used to analyse information from other fields in which its application may not be appropriate. In ecoacoustics, SWI is used to compare acoustic diversity (i.e. a measure derived by integrating the richness and abundance of animal sounds) between locations. In animal communication, SWI is used to quantify repertoire complexity (i.e. a measure derived by integrating the number and abundance of sound types produced by individuals or species) as an approach to understanding signal evolution. We discuss problems associated with using the SWI in ecoacoustics and animal communication. Specifically, we discuss conceptual and statistical problems associated with the SWI and then illustrate these problems using hypothetical data. In ecoacoustics, the SWI's assumptions of random variables and independent samples are often violated. In animal communication, the SWI fails to distinguish among repertoires in which the number of sound types and the abundance of each sound type differ. We also show that other methods do capture these differences. We conclude that the SWI does not adequately represent acoustic diversity or repertoire complexity due to the multiple conceptual and statistical issues associated with its use. We recommend other analytical methods to more fully describe these biological systems, including goodness of fit, Morisita similarity index and Markov chain analysis. These methods provide more information for future comparisons and permit researchers to test hypotheses more directly.",Ecoacoustics;bioacoustics;repertoire;Shannon-Weiner entropy index;statistical analysis;soundscape,BIOACOUSTICS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SOUND AND ITS RECORDING,2019,JUL 4,Article,English,Zoology

To quantify errors, we developed an on-line quiz based on vocalizations of an undisclosed set of 41 antbird (Thamnophilidae) and woodcreeper (Dendrocolaptinae) species. We invited experts to answer the quiz and obtained 820 answers from 20 participants. The answers were compared to the results of a binomial experiment with a success probability of 0.5; i.e. we examined whether participants identified species correctly more often than expected by the toss of a coin with a 50\% chance of producing the right identification. We also examined whether species were correctly identified more often than expected under a similar coin toss experiment. Quiz answers were compiled in a triangular matrix showing species ranked by taxonomic order on both axes. From the triangular matrix we can ask whether closely-related species were mistaken for each other, i.e. confused, more often than distantly-related species. We tested this hypothesis with a null model approach that compared the mean taxonomic distance between confused species in the observed matrix to the distribution of mean taxonomic distances between confused species in 10,000 randomized matrices. Finally, we drew a dendrogram to represent the similarity between species with regard to the distribution of identification errors. The 20 participants who took the quiz showed substantial variation in their ability to identify species correctly. Fourteen species were correctly identified more often than expected at random, while only one was misidentified more often than expected at random. The observed mean distance between confused species was smaller than all of the mean distances from the randomized, null-model matrices, indicating that confusions are more frequent between closely related species than between distant ones.",bioacoustic sampling;bird vocalizations;central Amazon;Dendrocolaptinae;false positives;misidentification;Thamnophilidae,REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA,2016,SEP,Article,English,Ornithology

Vector surveillance, based on wingbeat frequency and other parameters, is becoming increasingly important in the development of automated identification systems, but inconsistent data quality and results frequently emerge from different techniques and data processing methods which have not been standardized on wingbeat collection of numerous species. We developed a simple method to detect and record mosquito wingbeat by multi-dimensional optical sensors and collected 21,825 wingbeat files from 29 North American mosquito species. In pairwise comparisons, wingbeat frequency of twenty six species overlapped with at least one other species. No significant differences were observed in wingbeat frequencies between and within individuals of Culex quinquefasciatus over time. This work demonstrates the potential utility of quantifying mosquito wingbeat frequency by infrared light sensors as a component of an automated mosquito identification system.

We developed a flexible protocol called ``validation prediction{''} that uses machine learning to predict whether recognizer detections are true or false positives and can be applied to any recognizer type, ecological application, or analytical approach. Validation prediction uses a predictable relationship between recognizer score and the energy of an acoustic signal but can also incorporate any other ecological or spectral predictors (e.g., time of day, dominant frequency) that will help separate true from false-positive recognizer detections. First, we documented the relationship between recognizer score and the energy of an acoustic signal for two different recognizer algorithm types (hidden Markov models and convolutional neural networks). Next, we demonstrated our protocol using a case study of two species, the Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor) and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla). We reduced the number of detections that required validation by 75.7\% and 42.9\%, respectively, while retaining at least 98\% of the true-positive detections. Validation prediction substantially improves the efficiency of using automated recognition on acoustic data sets.

The sister species P. lateristriga and P. olfersii have pulsed advertisement calls that have been described as a noisy and long-lasting warbling sound. We provide the first account of inclusion of tonal sounds as part of the vocal repertoire of these species. Pure tones can (1) be long and form the entire call; (2) form prefixes of variable length separated by silence from the advertisement call; (3) be brief and form the onset or the offset of the regular advertisement call. Tonal calls may be an evolutionary novelty and they are not known from other populations of P. olfersii and P. lateristriga. Identification of the mechanism of sound production and of the behavioural roles of these unique calls may help elucidate the evolution of call complexity in frogs.,Animal communication;bioacoustics;Leiuperinae;vocal repertoire,ACTA HERPETOLOGICA,2019,JUN,Article,English,Zoology
,Bioacoustic monitoring of lower North Island bird communities before and after aerial application of 1080,"Bomans,Roald;Cook,Asher;Hartley,Stephen",Victoria University Wellington,"Modem aerial 1080 (sodium monofluoroacetate) operations are effective in reducing population densities of possums, rats and stoats, thereby reducing predation pressure on birds. Debate regarding 1080 use, however, continues to centre on potential non-target effects, with some groups claiming that birds are killed in large numbers such that forests ``fall silent{''}. We investigated these claims by recording birdsong for 5-8 weeks before and after three separate 1080 operations in the Aorangi and Remutaka Ranges of the lower North Island. New Zealand. A Before-After/Control-Impact (BACI) design was employed for each operation, with simultaneous monitoring carried out in treated and untreated sites using autonomous recording units. The amount of birdsong was quantified, scoring the presence/absence of species' calls in 30 ten second sub-samples for each of the 695 recordings analysed. The interaction between treatment and time and the ``BACI contrast{''} was tested for at the conununity- and population-level. After each operation, the amount of silence was the same or lower in sites treated with 1080 relative to paired non-treated sites. Six taxa showed no evidence of an effect of 1080. while two of 26 taxa/treatment tests showed a significant interaction between treatment and time consistent with the silent forest hypothesis: chaffinch and tomtit calling rates declined following the Aorangi 2017 and Aorangi 2014 operations respectively. At p < 0.05, one or two ``significant{''} results in 26 may be expected by chance. A negative impact on the introduced chaffinch (observed in one of three operations) is plausible considering the species' granivorous diet. The pathway for a negative impact on insectivorous tomtits is less obvious; as a precautionary approach we recommend further research. Overall, we found little evidence of forests falling silent after aerial 1080 operations and the likelihood of negative population-level impacts via poisoning of native birds was concluded to be very low.",1080;autonomous recording units;ARU;avian;BACI;non-target impacts;silent forest;sodium monofluoroacetate,NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2021,,Article,English,Ecology
10.1121/1.1336138,Bioacoustic spatial perception by humans: A controlled laboratory measurement of spatial resolution without distal cues,"Kay,L",,"The angular spatial resolution of a wide-angle air sonar using a continuous transmission frequency-modulated radiation, with the output coupled binaurally to the auditory system of a user, was measured under restrained controlled conditions. This was done to determine the effect of adding a narrow central field of view of 9 deg to a wide-angle sonar. The target objects were three equidistant vertical rods initially spaced apart by 10 deg. This was varied down to a spacing of 4 deg. Ten nonvisual subjects achieved an angular resolution of 6 deg. Four of these ten subjects continued learning to achieve an unexpected spatial resolution of 4 deg within the 9 deg central field. A mean error of approximately 1 deg in direction accuracy was achieved. It is inferred that the unique variations in the octave band ultrasonic echoes within the narrow field, and the invariance of the on-axis echo as one's head is turned, enables this angular resolution and accuracy to be achieved within the wide binaural field of view of 50 deg. This ability to resolve specula objects within a narrow angular resolution element of 9 deg is linked to the bat's ability to seemingly resolve object glints within a distal resolution element of less than 2 wavelengths.

We surveyed sounds of 25 doradoid species in 20 genera comparing these to sounds of four vocal outgroup catfish families. Sounds were either continuous waveforms (lacking interpulses) or pulsed (groups of pulses repeated at fixed temporal intervals). This is the first evidence for swimbladder calls with fixed interpulse patterns in catfishes. Vocal mechanism components that were similar between doradids and auchenipterids included: swimbladder shape, swimbladder dimensions and sonic muscle-somatic index. Morphological traits that showed variation among taxa and were evaluated for potential correlates of call diversity are: 1) diverticula (marginal outpocketings of the swimbladder with no connection to inner ear) and 2) elastic spring apparatus Mullerian rami (ESA-Mr). Within the doradid subfamilies and within the Auchenipteridae most species differed significantly in dominant frequency with frequency ranges overlapping to some extent for most. Doradid swimbladder diverticula did not explain dominant frequency variation within the doradoid superfamily. Some doradids with conical ESA-Mr had the highest dominant frequency sounds. Auchenipterids included both relatively lower and higher dominant frequency sound producers but lacked diverticula and had discoidal ESA-Mr. Comparing a phylogeny of doradoid genera with outgroup taxa, we infer that complex diverticula and conical ESA-Mr are derived characters within the Doradidae. Species representing outgroup families produced either continuous lower dominant frequency sounds (aspredinids, mochokids and pseudopimelodids) or pulsed higher dominant frequency sounds (pimelodids) {[}Current Zoology 58 (1): 171-188, 2012].",Catfishes;Communication;Signal evolution;Vocal mechanisms,CURRENT ZOOLOGY,2012,,Article,English,Zoology

Underwater acoustic signals are known to be noisy, especially as they are inevitably mixed with a large amount of environmental background noise, causing severe interference in the extraction of signal features and the revelation of internal laws. Furthermore, interference adds a considerable burden on the transmission, storage, and processing of data. A signal recognition curve (SRC) algorithm is proposed based on higher-order cumulants (HOC) and a recognition-sigmoid function for feature extraction of target signals. The signal data of interest can be accurately identified using the SRC. The analysis and verification of the algorithm are carried out in this study. The results show that when the SNR is greater than 7 dB, the SRC algorithm is effective, and the performance improvement is maximized when the SNR is 11 dB.

For this reason, discrimination between similar forms, based on signal patterns, allows for reproductively isolated species to be recognized. A calling signal produced by a mature male for attracting a conspecific female is a ``species passport{''} testifying that it belongs to the same species. This is the reason why the use of calling signal analysis for discriminating between the cryptic species or elucidating the taxonomic rank of dubious forms is highly efficient. In certain species, courtship signals also show species-specific patterns. In insect taxonomy, the study of acoustic signals is most promising in morphologically or/and ecologically heterogeneous groups. Chances that any morphologically homogeneous form will actually appear to be a complex of cryptic species are low The degree of signal variability differs in different orders, families and even congeneric species. For this reason, in every taxon investigated for the first time, it is necessary to evaluate the limits of signal intraspecific variability prior to using the acoustic characters in taxonomy. Species not involved into acoustic interactions due to allopatry, differences in host specialization, etc. can produce calling signals with identical patterns. Consequently, the similarity of signal structure in such species is by no means evidence of their synonymy.",,ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL,2013,DEC,Article,Russian,Zoology

Here, we provide a detailed analysis of several acoustic similarity indices, some of which have been developed with the specific aim of characterizing the sensory coding of auditory stimuli. We compare different approaches through the analysis of begging calls of several passerine species and specialist brood parasitic cuckoos that putatively evolved to mimic their hosts. The different bioacoustics distances did not provide consistently correlated similarity patterns, implying that they are sensitive to different sound features. However, the encoded spectrogram alignment method was correlated with all other acoustic distance metrics, suggesting that this method provides a consistent approach to use when the perceptually salient sound parameters are unknown for a particular species. Our analyses confirm that statistical similarity of begging calls can be detected in a New Zealand pair of host and specialist parasite species. We also show detectable similarity in two other Australasian host-parasite pairs and another New Zealand system, but to a more limited extent. By examining phylogenetic patterns in the begging call diversity, we also confirm that specialist cuckoos have evolved to mimic the begging calls of their hosts but host species have not co-evolved to modify their calls in response to begging call similarity by the parasite.

Relative to listening, we found that 1 min spectrograms in two 30 s frames yield the best time efficiency-accuracy trade-off. A standard occupancy model applied to visual scanning data underestimated occupancy estimates relative to listening data for three species and overestimated occupancy for one species. The observation-confirmation model used a subset of listening data to improve the estimates of detection probability from visual scanning and therefore reduced bias in occupancy estimates when compared with using visual scanning data alone. Overall, the combination of the visual scanning method and the observation-confirmation model allowed us to maintain the accuracy of occupancy estimates while greatly increasing the efficiency of anuran data processing.

Here, we revise the taxonomy of this complex based on an integrative approach utilizing morphology, songs and mitochondrial and nuclear DNA for all taxa. All taxa were diagnosably different in plumage, and there were also structural differences among them, although the northernmost populations of owstoni (sometimes recognized as jakuschima and shonis) were somewhat intermediate in plumage, structure and male plumage maturation between southern populations of owstoni and narcissina. All taxa had different songs, and a discriminant function analysis of four song variables correctly classified 100\% of all songs. A strongly supported phylogeny was recovered based on three mitochondrial genes and three nuclear introns (total of 3543bp), revealing a sister relationship between F.zanthopygia and the other taxa, between F.n.narcissina and F.n.owstoni, and between F.n.elisae and F.n.narcissina+F.n.owstoni. The corrected COI distances among the three F.narcissina subspecies ranged from 2.8\% (narcissina-owstoni) to 8.2\% (narcissina-elisae). We suggest that the congruent differences in multiple independent traits and the deep genetic divergences among the four taxa in the F.narcissina-F.zanthopygia complex support treatment of all of these taxa as separate species.

The goal of this study was to develop a method of extracting frequency contours from recordings of pulsed vocalizations and to test a nonlinear index of acoustic similarity based on the error of an artificial neural network at classifying them. Since the performance of neural networks depends on the amount of consistent variation in the training data, this technique can be used to assess such variation from samples of acoustic signals. The frequency contour extraction and the neural network index were tested on samples of one call type shared by nine social groups of killer whales. For comparison, call similarity was judged by three human subjects in pairwise classification tasks. The results showed a significant correlation between the neural network index and the similarity ratings by the subjects. Both measures of acoustic similarity were significantly correlated with the groups' association patterns, indicating that both methods of quantifying acoustic similarity are biologically meaningful.

Video processing is necessary to overcome noise-related problems, caused by suboptimal video capturing conditions, due to poor lighting or even complete darkness during overnight recordings. Modified wavelet-domain spatiotemporal Wiener filtering and motion-detection algorithms are employed to facilitate video enhancement, motion-activity-based indexing and summarization. Structural aspects for validation of the motion detection results are also used. The proposed system has been already deployed in monitoring of long-term abdominal sounds, for surveillance automation, motion-artefacts detection and connection with other psychophysiological parameters. However, it can be used to any video-assisted biomedical monitoring or other surveillance application with similar demands.

Acoustic masking of conspecific signals and adventitious cues is one mechanism that likely causes animals to abandon loud areas. However, masking effects can be difficult to document in situ and the effects of infrequent noise events may be impractical to study. Here, we present the Soundscapes model, a stochastic individual-based model that dynamically models the listening areas of animals searching for acoustic resources ({''}searchers{''}). The model also studies the masking effects of noise for human detections of the searchers. The model is set in a landscape adjacent to a road. Noise produced by vehicles traveling on that road is represented by calibrated spectra that vary with speed. Noise propagation is implemented using ISO-9613 procedures. We present demonstration simulations that quantify declines in searcher efficiency and human detection of searchers at relatively low traffic volumes, fewer than 50 vehicles per hour. Traffic noise is pervasive, and the Soundscapes model offers an extensible tool to study the effects of noise on bioacoustics monitoring, point-count surveys, the restorative value of natural soundscapes, and auditory performance in an ecological context.",Anthropogenic noise;Coupled dynamics;Habitat quality;Road ecology;Soundscape,OECOLOGIA,2022,MAY,Article,English,Ecology

Tadpoles were exposed individually in order to evaluate the progression of effects. Effects on sound production were complemented with common ecotoxicological endpoints (mortality, behavior, abnormalities and growth inhibition). C ornata was found to be more sensitive than other native (= 67\%, 50\%) and non-native species (= 75\%, 100\%) considering lethal and sublethal endpoints, respectively. Effects on sounds appear along with alterations in swimming, followed by the presence of mild, then severe abnormalities and finally death. Therefore, sound production may be a good biomarker since it anticipates other endpoints that are also affected by CPF. Ceratophrys ornata is a promising new model species in ecotoxicology.

10.1111/acv.12719,Modelling the distribution of bat activity areas for conservation in a Mediterranean mountain range,"Tena,Elena;Telleria,JoseLuis",,"There is a lack of studies designed to detect the most important areas for bat conservation. In this context, areas of high bat activity have been rarely considered in the delimitation of protected areas for bats, which are generally focused on the protection of roosting sites. This has been due to the difficulties of sampling the distribution of these nocturnal animals when moving at night. This methodological constraint has been overcome by the development of bioacoustic sampling, which allows mapping the occurrence of active bats over large areas. In this study, we use bat detectors to sample the distribution of bat activity in central Spain. This region is under the environmental effects of a mountain range (Guadarrama Mountains) and the urban encroachment of the city of Madrid. The occurrences provided by the detectors were used to produce species distribution models of which the resulting layers were arranged to detect the most suitable areas for bat richness and rarity indices. We performed a gap analysis to explore whether the areas most commonly used by active bats are covered by the current network of protected areas. The results showed that the best areas of high bat activity are located at the piedmont of the mountains and that most of these areas overlap with the existing network of protected areas. The best areas for bats excluded the most urbanized areas and within a similar urban gradient, protected areas tended to be located within the best sites for conservation. These results suggest that bats currently benefit from a network of protected areas initially aimed to protect birds and habitats (Natura 2000). In addition, monitoring areas of high bat activity could complement roosting site protection in the conservation of bat assemblages.",activity areas;bat conservation;bioacoustic sampling;Chiroptera;gap analysis;protected areas network;species distribution models;urban gradient,ANIMAL CONSERVATION,2022,FEB,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology

We evaluated these using proximity logging-GPS enabled tracking collars on wild koalas and discuss their implications for the mating system of this species. The frequency and duration of male-female encounters increased during the breeding season, with male-male encounters quite uncommon, suggesting little direct mating competition. By comparison, female-female interactions were very common across both seasons. Body mass of males was not correlated with their interactions with females during the breeding season, although male size is associated with a variety of acoustic parameters indicating individuality. We hypothesise that vocal advertising reduces the likelihood of male-male encounters in the breeding season while increasing the rate of male-female encounters. We suggest that male mating-season bellows function to reduce physical confrontations with other males allowing them to space themselves apart, while, at the same time, attracting females. We conclude that indirect male-male competition, female mate choice, and possibly female competition, mediate sexual selection in koalas.",,PLOS ONE,2015,JUL 8,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

Acoustic recording units (ARUs) require minimal cost and effort to deploy and inform relative activity, or encounter rates, for multiple species simultaneously. ARU-based surveys require post-processing of the recordings via software algorithms that assign a species label to each recording. The automated classification process can result in cross-species misidentifications that should be accounted for when employing statistical modelling for conservation decision-making. Using simulation and ARU-based detection counts from 17 bat species in British Columbia, Canada, we investigate three strategies for adjusting statistical inference for species misclassification: (a) `coupling' ambiguous and unambiguous detections by validating a subset of survey events post-hoc, (b) using a calibration dataset on the software algorithm's (in)accuracy for species identification or (c) specifying informative Bayesian priors on classification probabilities. We explore the impact of different Bayesian prior specifications for the classification probabilities on posterior estimation. We then consider how the quantity of data validated post-hoc impacts model convergence and resulting inferences for bat species relative activity as related to nightly conditions and yearly site occupancy after accounting for site-level environmental variables. Coupled methods resulted in less bias and uncertainty when estimating relative activity and species classification probabilities relative to calibration approaches. We found that species that were difficult-to-detect and those that were often inaccurately identified by the software required more validation effort than more easily detected and/or identified species. Our results suggest that, when possible, acoustic surveys should rely on coupled validated detection information to account for false-positive detections, rather than uncoupled calibration datasets. However, if the assemblage of interest contains a large number of rarely detected or less prevalent species, an intractable amount of effort may be required, suggesting there are benefits to curating a calibration dataset that is representative of the observation process. Our findings provide insights into the practical challenges associated with statistical analyses of ARU data and possible analytical solutions to support reliable and cost-effective decision-making for wildlife conservation/management in the face of known sources of observation errors.",acoustic data;count detection model;coupled classification;false positives;occupancy modelling;species misclassification;survey effort,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2022,JUN,Article,English,Ecology

Given the strong attenuation of echolocation calls, we predicted that territorial males of a harem-polygy nous species ought to forage at close distance to females to survey their movements by social eavesdropping. We estimated a maximum detection distance of 38 m for echolocation calls of Saccopteryx bilineata (Temminck, 1838) (Chiroptera; Emballonuridae) broadcasted within the forest under the sound transmission conditions of our study site and for an assumed signal detection threshold of 20 dB SPL (50 m for a threshold of 0 dB SPL). We then simultaneously radio-tracked the nocturnal movements of eight male-female pairs that each rested in the same harem territory during the day and measured the distances at which dyads foraged. Male-female pairs foraged at a median distance of 139 m. In the case of 90\% of simultaneous bearings, males foraged at distances that prevented eavesdropping on 44 kHz echolocation calls (>38 m; 87\% of radio fixes >50 m). Males and females of the same daytime territory roosted, on average, 226 +/- 194 m apart from each other at night. Thus, males were most likely unaware of where females foraged as a result of the strong attenuation of female echolocation calls. In general, such acoustic constraints on social eavesdropping may promote extra-harem group paternities, female choice, and sperm competition in bats, and may therefore present an important selective force in the evolution of bat mating systems.",,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,2007,AUG,Article,English,Zoology

In southern Turkey, two Chiff chaffs were identified which carried a novel haplotype, recently discovered in Northern Israel. Both individuals from Turkey looked somewhat brighter and more yellowish than typical brevirostris, but their song clearly corresponded to the brevirostris dialect. The form brevirostris, inhabiting the western and central regions of Northern Turkey, was found to be the most distinct among all `greenish' taxa, due to its small body size, wing formula and distinct vocal dialect. Paradoxically, the mitochondrial DNA of brevirostris is almost identical with caucasicus, whereas, in this respect, menzbieri is different from both. We believe that this paradox can be explained if we suppose that caucasicus originated during the ancient hybridization of brevirostris and menzbieri.

Apex predators, such as the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), can provide valuable insights into the ecosystem processes of the deep sea, where little direct observation can be made. Sperm whales are often difficult to observe at sea, as they inhabit deep, offshore waters and spend most of their lives beneath the surface. However, sperm whales are extremely amenable to passive acoustic monitoring, as their vocalizations are well-studied, highly distinguishable, produced regularly, and can be detected at relatively long ranges (>10 km). Sperm whales produce distinct clicks in two behavioral contexts (social interaction or foraging/prey capture); thus, we can use acoustic detection of these vocalizations to infer patterns of large-scale, collective behavior, which is similar to studying calling frogs or insects indicating their reproductive phonology. We recorded behaviorally-specific sperm whale vocalizations at three sites in the Northern Gulf of Mexico in July 2010 and 2011. We used these recordings to construct population-level time budgets, an empirical collective metric of behavior, based on the ratio of hours in a day with social clicks to the hours in a day with foraging clicks, and represented this as an ``acoustic activity index.{''} Our index showed significant differences in the proportions of social and foraging behavior across the range of sperm whales in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, and the proportion of social activity increased by more than a factor of two from 2010 to 2011. These differences support previous evidence of differential habitat use by sperm whales in the Gulf of Mexico, and suggest possible changes in environmental conditions between years. Thus, the acoustic activity index may provide a powerful way to evaluate changes in behavior and link them to changing ecological conditions. This novel application of bioacoustics to constructing time budgets and creating a behaviorally-based index at the population scale can serve as an indicator of ecological change, and greatly enhance our ability to understand the behavior and ecology of many acoustically active species.

The wolf (Canis lupus) is the most studied large carnivore in the world. After a massive decline and several local extinctions, mostly due to direct persecutions, wolves are now recolonizing many areas of their historical natural range. One of the main monitoring techniques is the howling survey, which is based on the wolves' tendency to use vocalisations to mark territory ownership in response to howls of unknown individuals. In most cases wolf howling sessions are useful for the localisation of the pack, but they provide only an aural estimation of the chorus size. We tested and present a new bioacoustic approach to estimate chorus size by recording wolves' replies and visualising choruses through spectrograms and spectral envelopes. To test the methodology, we compared: a) the values detected by visual inspections with the true chorus size to test for accuracy; b) the bioacoustic estimations of a sample of free-ranging wolves' replies developed by different operators to test for precision of the method; c) the aural field estimation of chorus size of a sample of free-ranging wolves' replies with the sonogram analysis of the same recordings to test for difference between methods. Results: Visual inspection of the chorus by spectrogram and spectrum proved to be useful in determining the number of concurrent voices in a wolf chorus. Estimations of chorus size were highly correlated with the number of wolves counted in a pack, and 92 \% of 29 known chorus sizes were recognized by means of bioacoustic analysis. On the basis of spectrographic evidence, it was also possible to identify up to seven concurrent vocalisations in a chorus of nine wolves. Spectral analysis of 37 free ranging wolves' replies showed a high correlation between the chorus size estimations of the different operators (92.8 \%), but a low correlation with the aural estimation (59.2 \%). Conclusions: Wolf howling monitoring technique could be improved by recording wolves' replies and by using bioacoustic tools such as spectrograms and spectral envelopes to determine the size of the wolf chorus. Compared with other monitoring techniques (i.e., genetic analysis), bioacoustic analysis requires widely available informatic tools (i.e., sound recording set of devices and sound analysis software) and a low budget. Information obtained by means of chorus analysis can also be combined with that provided by other techniques. Moreover, howls can be recorded and stored in audio file format with a good resolution (i.e. in ``Wave{''} format), thus representing a useful tool for future listening and investigations, which can be countlessly employed without risks of time deterioration.",,FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY,2015,SEP 15,Article,English,Zoology

Here we present a complete species-level phylogeny based on DNA sequences (4876 base pairs) of three nuclear and four mitochondrial markers to clarify the phylogenetic relationships among and within all known species of this genus, as well as the phylogenetic position of the monospecific Scychellean Tachycnemis seychellensis. Although the performance to resolve supported clades of Heterixalus species differed among the investigated gene fragments when analyzed separately, we could identify five well-supported species groups within Heterixalus in the combined analysis of all gene fragments. Our data strongly support a Heterixalus-Tachycnemis clade, and indicate the probable monophyly of Heterixalus placed sister to Tachycnemis. However, the diversification of these lineages may have happened in a short interval of time, leading to an unstable placement of Tachycnemis in the single-gene fragment phylogenies. Referring to the hitherto existing classification of Heterixalus, which is predominantly based on chromatic and bioacoustic characters, we examined the relative performance of these data sets relative to our molecular phylogeny. A Bayesian tree reconstructed with a bioacoustic data set yielded a higher resemblance to the molecular phylogeny than a tree constructed using a chromatic data set, which supports the importance of bioacoustic characters for systematic analyses of these anurans.

The first bioacoustic analyses, including FFT-based spectrograms and sound pressure envelopes, confirmed that it could not be attributed to the known sound of any Italian nor Mediterranean species of cricket. In the ensuing weeks, field research at the original station and further localities on the southern coast of Pantelleria provided photographs, living specimens, and further audio records. As soon as the photos were shared among the authors, it became clear the species belonged to the genus Acheta. Further bioacoustic analyses and morphological comparison with type specimens of Mediterranean and North-African congenerics in relevant collections and the scientific literature were conducted: they confirmed that the findings could only be attributed to a still undescribed species that escaped detection due to its impervious and unfrequented habitat.

To understand why, we compared spine morphology and ecotype of silent and vocal clades. We determined vocal ability of laboratory specimens during disturbance behavior. Vocal families had bony (not flexible or segmented) spines, well-developed anterior and/or posterior serrations, and statistically significantly longer spines. We compared morphology of the proximal end of the pectoral spine between vocal and silent species. For vocal taxa, microscopic rounded or bladed ridges or knobs were present on the dorsal process. Most silent species had reduced processes with exclusively smooth, convoluted, or honeycombed surfaces very similar to spine-locking surfaces, or they had novel surfaces (beaded, vacuolated, cobwebbed). Most callichthyids had ridges but many were silent during disturbance. All doradid, most auchenipterid and most mochokid species were vocal and had ridges or knobs. Within the Auchenipteridae, vocal species had spines with greater weight and serration development but not length. Silent auchenipterids had thin, brittle, distally segmented spines with few microscopic serrations on only one margin and a highly reduced dorsal process lacking any known vocal morphology. Silent auchenipterids are derived and pelagic, while all vocal genera are basal and benthopelagic. This is the first phylogenetic evidence for stridulation mechanism loss within catfishes. Phylogenetic mapping of vocal ability, spine condition, and ecotype revealed the repeated presence of silence and vocal taxa, short and long spines, and ecotype shifts within clades.

A main challenge remains that most large-scale bioacoustic archives contain only a small percentage of animal vocalizations and a large amount of environmental noise, which makes it extremely difficult to manually retrieve sufficient vocalizations for further analysis - particularly important for species with advanced social systems and complex vocalizations. In this study deep neural networks were trained on 11,509 killer whale (Orcinus orca) signals and 34,848 noise segments. The resulting toolkit ORCA-SPOT was tested on a large-scale bioacoustic repository - the Orchive - comprising roughly 19,000 hours of killer whale underwater recordings. An automated segmentation of the entire Orchive recordings (about 2.2 years) took approximately 8 days. It achieved a time-based precision or positive-predictive-value (PPV) of 93.2\% and an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.9523. This approach enables an automated annotation procedure of large bioacoustics databases to extract killer whale sounds, which are essential for subsequent identification of significant communication patterns. The code will be publicly available in October 2019 to support the application of deep learning to bioaoucstic research.

Here, we use a UAV to record the signals of bats during morning roost re-entry. We designed a UAV to block the noise of the propellers from the receiving microphone, and report on the characteristics of bioacoustic recordings from a UAV. We report the first published characteristics of echolocation signals from bats during group flight and cave re-entry. We found changes in inter-individual time-frequency shape, suggesting that bats may use differences in call design when sensing in complex groups. Furthermore, our first documented successful recordings of animals in their natural habitat demonstrate that UAVs can be important tools for bioacoustic monitoring, and we discuss the ethical considerations for such monitoring.",,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2018,MAY 17,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

Organic farming is seen as an effective way of counteracting this trend. Despite this, relatively little research has been carried out on the effects of olive farming on biodiversity in Greece. This study uses bioacoustic monitoring for a first order assessment of the bird diversity in olive groves. It uses acoustic indices to compare the soundscape of eleven organic and eleven conventional olive groves in Messinia in southern Greece. Three bioacoustics indices: the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), the Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI) and the Bioacoustic Index (BIO) were used. Olive groves under organic farming had significantly higher values for the ACI and BIO indices, and a higher but not significant different value for the ADI index. Organic groves showed a much more heterogeneous and complex structure with a mixture of tree species and varying canopy height than conventional groves. Landscape variables were similar between management practices and did not influence the index results. Site level variables, especially underlying vegetation height, had a significant influence on the ACI and BIO indices. Our results suggest that bioacoustic indices could provide a cost effective and non-intrusive way for bird diversity monitoring.",Bird diversity;Olive grove;Soundscape ecology;Bioacoustics indices;Organic farming,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2019,AUG,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Environmental Sciences

A potential concern with digital recording systems is that changes in technology could affect detectability of birds and cause bias in trend estimates based on counts of birds detected. We evaluated several currently available commercial recording systems ranging from low-cost multipurpose digital recorders to custom-designed wildlife recorders (US\$250\$7000 price range) to examine possible differences among systems in species detection. We made recordings during Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) counts using several units concurrently, and asked several expert birders to listen to the recordings in a factorial design. We found that birders detected, on average, 10\% fewer species on some units compared to others, though there was high variance. Analysis of a subset of recordings, using spectrograms and repeated listening, suggested that approximate to 90\% of species on each BBS stop could be clearly detected on all units. The remaining species could be identified on at least one unit, but were hard or impossible to detect on others. We found that the recording unit with the lowest empirical signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) had the lowest number of birds detected on the BBS recordings, and that frequency-specific SNR differed among units. Missed detections were likely related to variation in internal noise and frequency-dependent sensitivity of the units, and were an issue for all systems regardless of price. We caution that researchers using recorders need to consider variation among recording systems in their study design, particularly for long-term monitoring programs. RESUMEN Los sistemas de grabacion acustica se estan usando mas frecuentemente para estimar ocupacion de habitat o abundancia relativa y para monitorear tendencias poblacionales a lo largo del tiempo. Una preocupacion potencial con los sistemas de grabacion digitales es que cambios en la tecnologia pueden afectar la deteccion de las aves y ocasionar sesgos en las tendencias estimadas a partir de conteos de aves detectadas. Evaluamos muchos sistemas de grabacion actualmente disponibles comercialmente que van desde sistemas de grabacion digital multiproposito de bajo costo hasta disenos personalizados para grabar vida silvestre (US \$250 \$7000 rango de precio) para examinar posibles diferencias entre sistemas en la deteccion de especies. Realizamos grabaciones durante conteos de BBS usando muchas unidades simultaneamente y realizando un diseno factorial le preguntamos a varios pajareros expertos que escucharan las grabaciones. Encontramos que los pajareros detectaron, en promedio, 10\% menos especies en algunas unidades comparado con otras, aunque hubo una gran variacion. Analisis de un subconjunto de las grabaciones, usando espectrogramas y repeticiones auditivas, sugieren que approximate to 90\% de las especies en cada punto de grabacion en los BBS puede ser claramente detectada en todas las unidades. Las especies ausentes pueden ser identificadas en al menos una de las unidades, pero fueron dificiles o imposible de detectar en otras unidades de grabacion. Encontramos que las unidades de grabacion con la mas baja senal empirica, senal de proporcion de ruido (SPR), tuvo el menor numero de aves detectadas en las grabaciones en los BBS y que la frecuencia especifica de SNR vario entre unidades. La perdida de detecciones estuvo probablemente relacionadas por el ruido interno y la sensibilidad creada por la dependencia a las frecuencias en cada unidad, lo cual fue un problema para todos los sistemas sin importar el precio. Recomendamos a los investigadores que usan sistemas de grabacion que necesitan considerar la variacion entre sistemas de grabacion en su diseno de estudio, particularmente en programas de monitoreo a largo plazo.",audio recording;autonomous;bioacoustic;detection;monitoring;occupancy,JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY,2013,MAR,Article,English,Ornithology

Recordings were obtained from individuals calling spontaneously (no playback was used in order to attract individuals) and were analyzed using software Raven Pro 1.3. Higher numbers of individuals were recorded in MOF than in SSF, and higher numbers of individuals occurred in the interior than at the edge forest in MOF; in SSF, the opposite was true. The availability of food and habitat occupancy could explain the higher individual number in MOF. The variations in the social call were particular to each study area; they were not related to the forest types.

Nonetheless, in strictly sympatric species occurring in the same territory and living on the host plants of the same species, i. e. involved into acoustic interactions with each other signal pattern is always distinctly different. Consequently, the similarity of signals can be considered as an evidence of synonymy only in sympatric forms dwelling on the same host plant. On the other hand, distinct differences in the signal pattern indicates conclusively that the forms investigated have the species status. Craspedolepta filifoliae sp. n. collected in the steppe of Transbaikalia on Filifolium sibiricum is described and illustrated.

Nine acoustic parameters of the whistles (duration, start, end, minimum and maximum frequencies, delta frequency, frequency at 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 of duration) were measured and whistles were classified into five contour forms. A total of 659 whistles were analyzed, of which 62.20 \% showed an ascending contour form. The Guiana dolphin emitted whistles with a fundamental frequency reaching 44.9 kHz.

These losses are reduced by strategic pesticide applications; however, current methods of monitoring these pests for making management decisions are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, improved methods to identify and monitor these bugs must be investigated in order to optimize pesticide applications. One such method would be to exploit the substrate-borne vibrational signals (SBVSs) of these insects. Recordings of SBVS for two prevalent regional pests, the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus, and southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula, were segmented into separate pulses of variable duration based on signal energy. For each pulse, the linear frequency cepstral coefficients, dominant frequency, and duration were calculated and used as features. These features were classified using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a probabilistic neural network (PNN) to discriminate these SBVS from incidental sounds and SBVS of different species from each other. Detection of SBVS generated by brown stink bugs was performed with over 92\% accuracy for single male-female pairs with both PNN and GMM and with over 86\% accuracy for 30 individuals with both PNN and GMM. Detection of SBVS generated by southern green stink bugs was performed with up to 82.5\% accuracy with PNN and 68.0\% accuracy with GMM for 30 individuals. Also, both PNN and GMM were over 90\% accurate in identifying SBVS of brown and southern green stink bugs. Concurrent detection of SBVS from noise and identification of SBVS of brown and southern green stink bugs was 83.3\% accurate using PNN and 71.5\% accurate using GMM.

Despite this usefulness, vocalizations are described in only nine of 29 in Melanophryniscus Gallardo, 1961. Here we describe the advertisement call of Melanophryniscus xanthostomus Baldo, Bornschein, Pie, Ribeiro, Firkowski \& Morato, 2015 of a population from Serra Dona Francisca, municipality of Campo Alegre, state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The advertisement call (of three males, total of 17 calls) comprises two segments (the first with short and single notes, followed by a multi-pulsed note), with a duration of 12.194-20.986 s, and dominant frequency of 3101-3618 Hz (first and second segments combined). The advertisement call of M. xanthostomus differs from its congeners mostly by the higher number of pulses in the second segment (294-1033; from 16 to 321 in the other Melanophryniscus species), except Melanophryniscus krauczuki Baldo \& Basso, 2004 (1018-1502 pulses in the second segment). This is the first described call of a phytotelm breeding Melanophryniscus, but it presents the same prototype (a compound call formed by two segments, the first composed of short notes followed by a long trill) of its congeners not-phytotelm breedings. This might indicate the advertisement call of Melanophryniscus as a conserved trait and thus can be considered diagnostic for the genus.",Atlantic Forest;bioacoustic;call description;natural history;vocalization,ZOOLOGIA,2019,JUL 31,Article,English,Zoology

The functioning of a major archive will be described with reference to the British Library Sound Archive. Preserving large collections for the long term is a primary concern in the digital age. While digitization and digital preservation has many advantages over analogue methods, the rate of technology change and lack of standardization are a serious problem for the world's major audio archives. Another challenge is to make collections more easily and widely accessible via electronic networks.

The proposed method combines multiresolution analysis with FD-based thresholding to compose a WT-FD filter, for enhanced separation of explosive LS (ELS) and BS (EBS) from the background noise. In particular, the WT-FD filter incorporates the WT-based multiresolution decomposition to initially decompose the recorded bioacoustic signal into approximation and detail space in the WT domain. Next, the FD of the derived WT coefficients is estimated within a sliding window and used to infer where the thresholding of the WT coefficients has to happen. This is achieved through a self-adjusted procedure that iteratively ``peels{''} the estimated FD signal and isolates its peaks produced by the WT coefficients corresponding to ELS or EBS. In this way, two new signals are constructed containing the useful and the undesired WT coefficients, respectively. By applying WT-based multiresolution reconstruction to these two signals, a first version of the desired signal and the background noise is provided, accordingly. This procedure is repeated until a stopping criterion is met, finally resulting in efficient separation of the ELS or EBS from the background noise. The proposed WT-FD filter introduces an alternative way to the enhancement of bioacoustic signals, applicable to any separation problem involving nonstationary transient signals mixed with uncorrelated stationary background noise. The results from the application of the WT-FD filter to real bioacoustic data are presented and discussed in an accompanying paper.",bowel sounds;explosive character;fractal dimension thresholding;lung sounds;noise reduction;structure extraction;wavelet transform,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,2005,JUN,Article,English,"Engineering, Biomedical"

We studied the abilities of Leiopelma hamiltoni, a species evolutionarily basal to most living anurans, to communicate by means of chemosignals. We collected frogs in the field, held them in captivity for 72 It, and then tested their preferences for substrates that they had marked themselves to those marked by conspecifics. Individuals preferred paper towels that they had marked themselves to those marked by frogs collected from other home ranges. Preferences were greater, on average, when the conspecific had been collected farther away. Frogs did not discriminate between their own odor and those of other individuals with which they had shared a home range. Individuals preferred their own odor to a blank unmarked towel but also avoided odors of unfamiliar conspecifics when paired with a blank. The discovery of chemical communication in an archaic anuran offers a window into how frogs may have communicated before mechanisms of bioacoustic signaling evolved.

Here we assess the use of acoustic indices, using birds as a proxy for ecosystem health in a Northern Great Plains grassland system. We recorded soundscapes during bird morning chorus at 47 sites for 12-14 consecutive days and used these data to assess the accuracy of four acoustic indices (i.e. Bioacoustic Index; Acoustic Evenness Index; Acoustic Diversity Index; and Acoustic Complexity Index). We compared indices to bird richness derived from a trained ornithologist listening to sound recordings. The Bioacoustic Index (BI) and Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) had the absolute highest correlation with bird richness in Northern Great Plains systems. Where Bioacoustic Index had a positive correlation and Acoustic Complexity Index had a negative correlation with grassland birds. The latter had the opposite direction from the `theoretical' prediction. We further explored the relationship between indices and landscape gradients with known influences on bird diversity to further validate each index. We also discuss implications of acoustic indices as a tool for monitoring grassland birds. We found BI model outcomes align with known relationships between grassland birds and spatial covariates, whereas ACI did not concur these trends.

Recently, the symmetry concept has been applied in physics, and in mathematics to help make mathematical models tractable to achieve the best learning performance. Owing to the symmetry of the bioacoustics spectral, feature extraction can be achieved by integrating the techniques of Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and mentioned machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, neural network, and so on. At the beginning, the raw data information for our experiment is taken from a website which collects many kinds of frog sounds. This in fact saves us collecting the raw data by using a digital signal processing technique. The generally proposed system detects bioacoustic features by using the microphone sensor to record the sounds of different frogs. The data acquisition system uses an embedded controller and a dynamic signal module for making high-accuracy measurements. With regard to bioacoustic features, they are filtered through the MFCC algorithm. As the filtering process is finished, all values from ceptrum signals are collected to form the datasets. For classification and identification of frogs, we adopt the multi-layer FNNA algorithm in machine learning and the results are compared with those obtained by the SVM method at the same time. Additionally, two optimizer functions in neural network include: scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) and gradient descent adaptive learning rate (GDA). Both optimization methods are used to evaluate the classification results from the feature datasets in model training. Also, calculation results from the general central processing unit (CPU) and Nvidia graphics processing unit (GPU) processors are evaluated and discussed. The effectiveness of the experimental system on the filtered feature datasets is classified by using the FNNA and the SVM scheme.

Acoustic surveys are increasingly used to monitor biodiversity change, especially for bats as they are important indicator species and most use sound to detect, localise and classify objects. However, using bat acoustic surveys for monitoring poses several challenges, particularly in megadiverse regions. Many species lack reference recordings, some species have high call similarity or differ in call detectability, and quantitative classification tools, such as machine learning algorithms, have rarely been applied to data from these areas. Here, we collate a reference call library for bat species that occur in a megadiverse country, Mexico. We use 4685 search-phase calls from 1378 individual sequences of 59 bat species to create automatic species identification tools generated by machine learning algorithms (Random Forest). We evaluate the improvement in species-level classification rates gained by using hierarchical classifications, reflecting either taxonomic or ecological constraints (guilds) on call design, and examine how classification rate accuracy changes at different hierarchical levels (family, genus and guild). Species-level classification of calls had a mean accuracy of 66\%, and the use of hierarchies improved mean species-level classification accuracy by up to 6\% (species within families 72\%, species within genera 712\% and species within guilds 691\%). Classification accuracy to family, genus and guild-level was 917\%, 778\% and 825\%, respectively. The bioacoustic identification tools we have developed are accurate for rapid biodiversity assessments in a megadiverse region and can also be used effectively to classify species at broader taxonomic or ecological levels. This flexibility increases their usefulness when there are incomplete species reference recordings and also offers the opportunity to characterise and track changes in bat community structure. Our results show that bat bioacoustic surveys in megadiverse countries have more potential than previously thought to monitor biodiversity changes and can be used to direct further developments of bioacoustic monitoring programs in Mexico.",acoustic identification;guild;hierarchical classification;machine learning;Neotropical;random forest;whispering bats,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2016,SEP,Article,English,Ecology

Auditory devices used to deter wildlife are a potentially humane and effective way of minimising deleterious interactions with humans and their livelihoods and have been used successfully for many species around the world. Acoustic cues can be used to manipulate anti-predator behaviour, encouraging animals to forage elsewhere. Employing acoustics derived from natural sources to make use of innate behavioural responses has been suggested to outperform novel or artificial sounds; however, anti-predator strategies vary among sympatric species and will influence the utility of acoustic stimuli for deterring wildlife.

We aimed to test the interaction between the source of origin (natural or novel) and species traits (anti-predator strategy - grouping behaviour) on the efficacy of using acoustic stimuli to elicit alarm responses for two species in the family Macropodidae commonly associated with browsing on forest plantation seedlings; the red-necked pademelon (Thylogale thetis) and the red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus banksianus). Methods. We tested these factors in captivity using playback experiments of acoustic stimuli and monitored the behavioural responses of subjects. Results. Red-necked pademelons exhibited strong responses to bioacoustic and novel stimuli but did not greatly differentiate among them. Short-term habituation to predator calls was detected whereas responsiveness to novel sounds increased. Red-necked wallabies most strongly responded to conspecific distress calls, showing no sign of short-term habituation. Conclusions. Results from the present and other studies suggest that bioacoustic deterrents, particularly those utilising natural conspecific sounds, aimed at communicating danger, have the potential to play an important role in non-lethal wildlife management, although that responsiveness varies with the form of anti-predator strategies employed. Implications. If alarm responses translate into subjects vacating targeted areas, then there is some potential to implement non-lethal acoustic deterrents for macropodids alongside other management measures aimed at preventing impacts on primary production. Problematically, our experiments showed that without accurate acoustic delivery, particularly of sounds with infrasonic components, the development of effective bioacoustic deterrents may remain stymied.",alert behaviour;bioacoustics;conspecific signalling;Macropus rufogriseus banksianus;non-lethal management;species traits;Thylogale thetis,WILDLIFE RESEARCH,2011,,Article,English,Ecology;Zoology

Members of the genus Chaetodon have a laterophysic connection (LC)-a unique association of anterior swim bladder horns and the cranial lateral line - but the action of the LC system on auditory sensitivity is unexplored. Here, we show in baseline auditory evoked potential threshold experiments that Forcipiger flavissimus (which lacks swim bladder horns and LC) is sensitive to sound tones from 100 Hz up to 1000 Hz, and that thresholds for three species of Chaetodon are 10-15 dB lower, with extended hearing ranges up to 1700-2000 Hz. The relatively high thresholds to sound pressure and low pass response near 500 Hz for all four species are consistent with a primary sensitivity to hydrodynamic particle acceleration rather than sound pressure. Deflation of the swim bladder in F. flavissimus had no measurable effect on auditory sensitivity. In contrast, displacement of gas from the swim bladder horns in Chaetodon multicinctus and Chaetodon auriga increased thresholds (decreased sensitivity) by 5-20 dB, with the greatest effect at 600 Hz. The evolution of swim bladder horns associated with the LC system in Chaetodon species has increased hearing sensitivity through sound pressure transduction in the frequency bands used for social acoustic communication. The close affiliative behaviors that are common in Chaetodon species and other butterflyfish facilitate sound perception and acoustic communication at close distances relative to the high background noise levels found in their natural reef environment.",Behavior;Bioacoustic;Communication;Fish;Hydrodynamic;Infrasound;Social behavior,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,2015,MAY,Article,English,Biology

However, when studying acoustic behaviours of marine animals in confined volumes, the effects of reverberation must be characterized, something that has been overlooked in parts of the marine ecology literature. In this study, we characterized reverberation in tanks using an artificial sound source and examined the implications for bioacoustic studies using sounds emitted by the European lobster Homarus gammarus during feeding and in response to stress. Broadband and transient sounds commonly produced by crustaceans were severely impacted by reverberation such that their spectral characteristics and pulse width durations could not be assessed. In contrast, lowfrequency sounds could be characterized in tanks, but not their source level. Based on these observations, we describe a simple methodology to identify which sound characteristics can be measured in tanks. When feeding, the lobsters produced broadband and transient sounds called `rattles', similar to sounds reported for tropical spiny lobsters Palinurus longipes and P. argus. When stressed, H. gammarus vibrated its carapace, producing a low-frequency sound analogous to the `buzzing' sound of the American lobster H. americanus. The potential role of species-specific sound is discussed; however, although our observations represent the first bioacoustic characterization of H. gammarus, additional behavioural studies are necessary to understand their ecological meaning.",European lobster;Passive acoustics;Tanks;Reverberation;Rattle;Buzzing sound;Spectral analysis,AQUATIC BIOLOGY,2018,,Article,English,Marine \& Freshwater Biology

These inaudible insects often pose a significant threat to food security as pests of key agricultural crops worldwide. Automatic detection of such insects is crucial to the future of crop protection by providing critical information to assess the risk to a crop and the need for preventative measures. We describe an experimental set-up designed to derive audio recordings from a range of weak-flying aphids and beetles using an LED array. A rigorous data processing pipeline was developed to extract meaningful features, linked to morphological characteristics, from the audio and harmonic series for six aphid and two beetle species. An ensemble of over 50 bioacoustic parameters was used to achieve species discrimination with a success rate of 80\%. The inclusion of the dominant and fundamental frequencies improved prediction between beetles and aphids because of large differences in wingbeat frequencies. At the species level, error rates were minimized when harmonic features were supplemented by features indicative of differences in species' flight energies.",Aphid;beetle;insect classification;random forest classification;wingbeat harmonics,AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY,2021,NOV,Article,English,Entomology

We propose that combining bioacoustic monitoring with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology could reduce some of these biases and allow bird surveys to be conducted in less accessible areas. We tested the feasibility of the UAV approach to songbird surveys using a low-cost quadcopter with a simple, lightweight recorder suspended 8 m below the vehicle. In a field experiment using playback of bird recordings, we found that small variations in UAV altitude (it hovered at 28, 48, and 68 m) didn't have a significant effect on detections by the recorder attached to the UAV, and we found that the detection radius of our equipment was comparable with detection radii of standard point counts. We then field tested our equipment, comparing songbird detections from our UAV-mounted recorder with standard point-count data from 51 count stations. We found that the number of birds per point on UAV counts was comparable with standard counts for most species, but there were significant underestimates for some-specifically, issues of song masking for a species with a low-frequency song, the Mourning Dove (Zenaida macroura); and underestimation of the abundance of a species that was found in very high densities, the Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis). Species richness was lower on UAV counts (mean = 5.6 species point(-1)) than on standard counts (8.3 species point (-1)), but only slightly lower than on standard counts if nonaudible detections are omitted (6.5 species point (-1)). Excessive UAV noise is a major hurdle to using UAVs for bioacoustic monitoring, but we are optimistic that technological innovations to reduce motor and rotor noise will significantly reduce this issue. We conclude that UAV-based bioacoustic monitoring holds great promise, and we urge other researchers to consider further experimentation to refine techniques.",bioacoustics;drone;methodology;songbird;UAV,AUK,2017,APR,Article,English,Ornithology

A wide range of statistical methods, including various automated methods, have been used to successfully classify vocalizations based on species, sex, geography, and individual. A comprehensive approach focusing on identifying acoustic features putatively involved in classification is required for the prediction of features necessary for discrimination in the real world. Here, we used several classification techniques, namely discriminant function analyses (DFAs), support vector machines (SVMs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), for sex-based classification of zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) distance calls using acoustic features measured from spectrograms. We found that all three methods (DFAs, SVMs, and ANNs) correctly classified the calls to respective sex-based categories with high accuracy between 92 and 96\%. Frequency modulation of ascending frequency, total duration, and end frequency of the distance call were the most predictive features underlying this classification in all of our models. Our results corroborate evidence of the importance of total call duration and frequency modulation in the classification of male and female distance calls. Moreover, we provide a methodological approach for bioacoustic classification problems using multiple statistical analyses.

Even in the hand, capuchino females cannot be accurately diagnosed to the species level based solely on visual plumage examination, which may present a problem for future research on this group. During 10 years of field research on this group, we observed subtle vocal differences. We studied females of two parapatric species that may breed in syntopic upland grassland areas in southern Brazil: Tawny-bellied Seedeater Sporophila hypoxantha and Black-bellied Seedeater Sporophila melanogaster. Our main aim was to measure dissimilarities between inter-specific and intersexual repertory calls. We found unequivocal inter-specific divergences in call type repertoires revealed by cluster analysis, and no intersexual differences in the co-specific repertoire calls. These combined results enhance the understanding about the role of repertoire calls on species-specific recognition and interbreeding isolation processes (assortative mating), and provide a way to overcome the problem of field identification of female capuchinos at the species level.",acoustic communication;assortative mating;bioacoustic;songbirds;Sporophila;vocal repertory,REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ORNITOLOGIA,2019,JUN,Article,English,Ornithology

In birds, the combined application of bioacoustic and molecular criteria has led to an avalanche of cryptic species discoveries over the last two decades in which findings of deep vocal differentiation have usually been corroborated by molecular data or vice versa. In this study, we use genome-wide DNA data to uncover an unusual case of cryptic speciation in two species within the South-east Asian Streak-eared Bulbul Pycnonotus blanfordi complex, in which both morphology and vocalizations have remained extremely similar. Despite a considerable pre-Pleistocene divergence of these two bulbul species, bioacoustic analysis failed to uncover differences in their main vocalization, but examination of live birds revealed important differences in eye color that had been overlooked in museum material. Our study demonstrates that genome-wide DNA data can be helpful in the detection of cryptic speciation, especially in species that have evolved limited morphological and behavioral differences.

Animals produce sounds for diverse biological functions such as defending territories, attracting mates, deterring predators, navigation, finding food and maintaining contact with members of their social group. Biologists can take advantage of these acoustic behaviours to gain valuable insights into the spatial and temporal scales over which individuals and populations interact. Advances in bioacoustic technology, including the development of autonomous cabled and wireless recording arrays, permit data collection at multiple locations over time. These systems are transforming the way we study individuals and populations of animals and are leading to significant advances in our understandings of the complex interactions between animals and their habitats. 2. Here, we review questions that can be addressed using bioacoustic approaches, by providing a primer on technologies and approaches used to study animals at multiple organizational levels by ecologists, behaviourists and conservation biologists. 3. Spatially dispersed groups of microphones (arrays) enable users to study signal directionality on a small scale or to locate animals and track their movements on a larger scale. 4. Advances in algorithm development can allow users to discriminate among species, sexes, age groups and individuals. 5. With such technology, users can remotely and non-invasively survey populations, describe the soundscape, quantify anthropogenic noise, study species interactions, gain new insights into the social dynamics of sound-producing animals and track the effects of factors such as climate change and habitat fragmentation on phenology and biodiversity. 6. There remain many challenges in the use of acoustic monitoring, including the difficulties in performing signal recognition across taxa. The bioacoustics community should focus on developing a common framework for signal recognition that allows for various species' data to be analysed by any recognition system supporting a set of common standards. 7. Synthesis and applications. Microphone arrays are increasingly used to remotely monitor acoustically active animals. We provide examples from a variety of taxa where acoustic arrays have been used for ecological, behavioural and conservation studies.

The TVSS's 360-degree vertical imaging plane allows simultaneous identification of multiple volume scattering sources and their discrimination from backscatter at the sea surface or the seafloor. This imaging capability is used to construct a three-dimensional representation of a pelagic fish school near the bottom. Scattering layers imaged in the mixed layer and upper thermocline are attributed to assemblages of epipelagic zooplankton. The fine scale patchiness of these scatterers is assessed with the two-dimensional variance spectra of vertical volume scattering strength images in the upper and middle water column. Mean volume reverberation levels exhibit a vertical directionality which is attributed to the volume scattering layers. Boundary echo sidelobe interference and reverberation is shown to be the major limitation in obtaining bioacoustic data with the TVSS.

Here we describe the three-dimensional kinematic and bioacoustic details of this behaviour, first, as naive bats learn to deal with an unpalatable model tiger moth and subsequently, as they avoid acoustic mimics. The tiger moths' first clicks influenced the bats' echolocation behaviour and the percentage of interactions that included terminal buzzes was associated with capture and investigatory behaviour. When the mimic was introduced, the bats decreased both their minimum distance to the tiger moth and the time at which they broke off their attack compared with their exposure to the model on the night before. These kinematic signatures closely match the bats' behaviour on their first night of experience with the model. Minimum distances and time of pursuit cessation increased again by the last night of the mimic's presentation. These kinematic and bioacoustic results show that although naive bats generalize the meaning of aposematic tiger moth calls, they discriminate the prey-generated signals as different and investigate. Extrapolating to experienced bats, these results suggest that acoustic predators probably exert potent and fine-scaled selective forces on acoustic mimicry complexes.",kinematics;bioacoustics;bats;moths;Arctiidae;acoustic mimicry,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,2009,JUL 15,Article,English,Biology

Previous studies on urban biodiversity using acoustics are often limited by data continuity and survey scope, making it difficult to answer questions about relationships between bird population dynamics and environmental factors. To some extent, big data methods such as continuous acoustic monitoring have bridged this gap and provided new research paths to address the problem. In this study, we proposed a machine learning (ML) method that uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) and target sound area ratios (TSAR) to quantify the dominance of seven types of acoustic scenes. Acoustic data was recorded at nine sites in three urban forests in Guangzhou, China. Using the site-related sound data, we trained the convolutional neural network and identified seven target soundscape components with an overall F1 score of 0.97, a precision of 0.96, and a recall of 0.97. Spatial patterns of acoustic scenes in urban forests were examined to understand the effective working radius of monitoring equipment and the impacts of differing land use types on the composition of soundscapes. This study indicates significant interactions between human activities and biodiversity using acoustics, demonstrates that vocal organisms respond to environmental changes primarily by changes in their vocal frequencies, and proposes a novel framework for utilizing acoustics to monitor urban biodiversity.

Understanding the soundscape composition and correlations between acoustic indices and species richness of birds, the most important sound source in the ecosystem, are of great importance for measuring biodiversity and the level of anthropogenic disturbance. In this study, based on yearlong sound data obtained from five acoustic sensors deployed in Dalongtan, Shennongjia National Park, we analyzed the soundscape composition by comparing the distributions of the soundscape power in different frequency ranges, and examined the correlations between acoustic indices and bird species richness by means of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient method.

Currently, only visual survey methods are used, which are mostly unable to detect the presence of wood-boring insects. Bioacoustic detection, however, exploits sounds and vibrations produced by larvae during feeding and other movements inside the wood. Bioacoustic detection methods require mounting of the sensors, which can be complicated, time consuming and may even damage the surface of the tested material. Laser vibrometry avoids all these problems as vibrations produced by the larvae are detected via the laser beam. We used a portable digital laser vibrometer to detect the activity of mining ALB larvae within poplar logs. Three types of pulses were recorded: the broadband pulses lasting 1-2 ms were the most frequent, with frequency maxima between 8 and 13 kHz. Less frequent were the low and the high frequency pulses, covering frequency bands between 4 and 7, and 9 and 20 kHz, respectively. The signal-to-noise ratio across the whole frequency range (0-22 kHz) of the laser vibrometer was around 35 dB. We show that laser vibrometry can be successfully employed as a non-destructive diagnostic tool for detecting infestations by the wood-boring beetles.",Acoustic detection;Laser vibrometer;Wood-boring beetles;Asian longhorned beetle;Invasive species,JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,2015,MAR,Article,English,Entomology

Passive acoustic monitoring, the use of unattended recording devices to capture environmental sound, is an example where technological advances have facilitated an influx of data that routinely exceeds the capacity for analysis. Computational advances, particularly the integration of machine learning approaches, will support data extraction efforts. However, the analysis and interpretation of these data will require parallel growth in conceptual and technical approaches for data analysis. Here, we use a large hand-annotated dataset to showcase analysis approaches that will become increasingly useful as datasets grow and data extraction can be partially automated. We propose and demonstrate seven technical approaches for analyzing bioacoustic data. These include the following: (1) generating species lists and descriptions of vocal variation, (2) assessing how abiotic factors (e.g., rain and wind) impact vocalization rates, (3) testing for differences in community vocalization activity across sites and habitat types, (4) quantifying the phenology of vocal activity, (5) testing for spatiotemporal correlations in vocalizations within species, (6) among species, and (7) using rarefaction analysis to quantify diversity and optimize bioacoustic sampling. To demonstrate these approaches, we sampled in 2016 and 2018 and used hand annotations of 129,866 bird vocalizations from two forests in New Hampshire, USA, including sites in the Hubbard Brook Experiment Forest where bioacoustic data could be integrated with more than 50 years of observer-based avian studies. Acoustic monitoring revealed differences in community patterns in vocalization activity between forests of different ages, as well as between nearby similar watersheds. Of numerous environmental variables that were evaluated, background noise was most clearly related to vocalization rates. The songbird community included one cluster of species where vocalization rates declined as ambient noise increased and another cluster where vocalization rates declined over the nesting season. In some common species, the number of vocalizations produced per day was correlated at scales of up to 15 km. Rarefaction analyses showed that adding sampling sites increased species detections more than adding sampling days. Although our analyses used hand-annotated data, the methods will extend readily to large-scale automated detection of vocalization events. Such data are likely to become increasingly available as autonomous recording units become more advanced, affordable, and power efficient. Passive acoustic monitoring with human or automated identification at the species level offers growing potential to complement observer-based studies of avian ecology.",bioacoustics;biodiversity assessment;birdsong;Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest;passive acoustic monitoring;rarefaction,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2022,APR,Article,English,Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

In the former case, the density and diversity of animal sounds can act as a measure of biodiversity. In the latter case, researchers often create control and treatment groups of animals, expose them to different interventions, and test for different outcomes. One possible manifestation of different outcomes may be changes in the bioacoustics of the animals. With such a plethora of important applications, there have been significant efforts to build bioacoustic classification tools. However, we argue that most current tools are severely limited. They often require the careful tuning of many parameters (and thus huge amounts of training data), are either too computationally expensive for deployment in resource-limited sensors, specialized for a very small group of species, or are simply not accurate enough to be useful. In this work we introduce a novel bioacoustic recognition/classification framework that mitigates or solves all of the above problems. We propose to classify animal sounds in the visual space, by treating the texture of their sonograms as an acoustic fingerprint using a recently introduced parameter-free texture measure as a distance measure. We further show that by searching for the most representative acoustic fingerprint, we can significantly outperform other techniques in terms of speed and accuracy.",Classification;sonogram;texture;bioacoustics;acoustic monitoring,JOURNAL OF INSECT BEHAVIOR,2013,JUL,Article,English,Entomology

We test model predictions using an extensive database of resting and calling metabolic rates of insects, amphibians and birds. Results are largely supportive of model predictions. Calling metabolic rates scale predictably with body mass and temperature such that calling and resting metabolic rates are directly proportional to each other. The cost of acoustic signalling is similar to 8 times higher than resting metabolic rate in ectotherms, and similar to 2 times higher in birds.

Moreover, this accuracy was increased by 100\% when using histogram-derived PCA values of F-0 and amplitudes of the first harmonic. We suggest that individual identification accuracy can be improved by including amplitude changes for species where F-0 has only been included so far.

In contrast, phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and cytochrome b sequences resolved highly supported clades that are in concordance with bioacoustic differences. The results support the specific distinctness of most nominal species recognized in the group, including the Bolivian Hypsiboas balzani and Hypsiboas callipleura, two species that were considered to be synonymous, and revealed the presence of an undescribed species from southern Peru, which is here described as Hypsiboas gladiator sp. n. In contrast, Hypsiboas andinus and Hypsiboas riojanus were mutually paraphyletic, and showed no differences in morphology and acoustic characters. Consequently, we regard the former as a junior synonym of the latter. However, we discovered that populations of H. riojanus from central Bolivia exhibit some degree of genetic differentiation and advertisement call differences with respect to Argentine populations, but sampling of these Bolivian populations is too sparse to draw taxonomic conclusions. Our phylogenetic results support the hypothesis that ancestral lineages of the Andean H. pulchellus group experienced successive splitting events along a latitudinal gradient from north to south.",,ZOOLOGICA SCRIPTA,2010,NOV,Article,English,Evolutionary Biology;Zoology

Traditional methods for studying population size and demographic features depend on labor-intensive field research. Passive acoustic monitoring provides an alternative method for quantifying population size and demographic parameters, but this approach requires careful validation. To determine the accuracy of passive acoustic monitoring for estimating population size and demographic parameters, we used autonomous recorders to sample an island-living population of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) over a 6-year period. Using the individually distinctive songs of males, we estimated the male population size as the number of unique songs detected in the recordings. We analyzed songs across 6 years to estimate birth year, death year, and longevity. We then compared the estimates with field data in a blind analysis. Estimates of male population size through passive acoustic monitoring were, on average, 72\% of the true male population size, with higher accuracy in lower-density years. Estimates of demographic rates were lower than true values by 29\% for birth year, 23\% for death year, and 29\% for longevity. This is the first investigation to estimate longevity with passive acoustic monitoring and adds to a growing number of studies that have used passive acoustic monitoring to estimate population size. Although passive acoustic monitoring underestimated true population parameters, likely due to the high similarity among many male songs, our findings suggest that autonomous recorders can provide reliable estimates of population size and longevity in a wild songbird.

10.3390/ani12162020,Introducing the Software CASE (Cluster and Analyze Sound Events) by Comparing Different Clustering Methods and Audio Transformation Techniques Using Animal Vocalizations,"Schneider,Sebastian;Hammerschmidt,Kurt;Dierkes,PaulWilhelm",Goethe University Frankfurt;Deutsches Primatenzentrum (DPZ),"Simple Summary Unsupervised clustering algorithms are widely used in ecology and conservation to classify animal vocalizations, but also offer various advantages in basic research, contributing to the understanding of acoustic communication. Nevertheless, there are still some challenges to overcome. For instance, the quality of the clustering result depends on the audio transformation technique previously used to adjust the audio data. Moreover, it is difficult to verify the reliability of the clustering result. To analyze bioacoustic data using a clustering algorithm, it is, therefore, essential to select a reasonable algorithm from the many existing algorithms and prepare the recorded vocalizations so that the resulting values characterize a vocalization as accurately as possible. Frequency-modulated vocalizations, whose frequencies change over time, pose a particular problem. In this paper, we present the software CASE, which includes various clustering methods and provides an overview of their strengths and weaknesses concerning the classification of bioacoustic data. This software uses a multidimensional feature-extraction method to achieve better clustering results, especially for frequency-modulated vocalizations. Unsupervised clustering algorithms are widely used in ecology and conservation to classify animal sounds, but also offer several advantages in basic bioacoustics research. Consequently, it is important to overcome the existing challenges. A common practice is extracting the acoustic features of vocalizations one-dimensionally, only extracting an average value for a given feature for the entire vocalization. With frequency-modulated vocalizations, whose acoustic features can change over time, this can lead to insufficient characterization. Whether the necessary parameters have been set correctly and the obtained clustering result reliably classifies the vocalizations subsequently often remains unclear. The presented software, CASE, is intended to overcome these challenges. Established and new unsupervised clustering methods (community detection, affinity propagation, HDBSCAN, and fuzzy clustering) are tested in combination with various classifiers (k-nearest neighbor, dynamic time-warping, and cross-correlation) using differently transformed animal vocalizations. These methods are compared with predefined clusters to determine their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, a multidimensional data transformation procedure is presented that better represents the course of multiple acoustic features. The results suggest that, especially with frequency-modulated vocalizations, clustering is more applicable with multidimensional feature extraction compared with one-dimensional feature extraction. The characterization and clustering of vocalizations in multidimensional space offer great potential for future bioacoustic studies. The software CASE includes the developed method of multidimensional feature extraction, as well as all used clustering methods. It allows quickly applying several clustering algorithms to one data set to compare their results and to verify their reliability based on their consistency. Moreover, the software CASE determines the optimal values of most of the necessary parameters automatically. To take advantage of these benefits, the software CASE is provided for free download.",bioacoustics;clustering methods;feature extraction;frequency-modulated vocalizations;multidimensional;vocalization classification;vocal repertoire,ANIMALS,2022,AUG,Article,English,"Agriculture, Dairy \& Animal Science;Veterinary Sciences;Zoology"

Bioacoustic analyses showed that the three species were clearly differentiated, despite the fact that disturbance stridulations presented the same stereotyped spectrographic pattern. Within each species, most of the subspecies and populations considered were also bioacoustically distinguishable. Subspecies and populations within each species were differentiated with regard to body size and stridulatory organ, and the length of the pars stridens was positively correlated with the width of the coxa, in turn positively correlated with body size. A few spectrographic measures were significantly constrained by the morphology of the stridulatory apparatus; in particular the duration of sound emission was positively correlated with the length of the apparatus and the sub-pulse rate was negatively related to the distance between two consecutive crests. For T. pyrenaeus, with the largest number of populations sampled, there was no significant correlation between morphological and spectrographic distances, but there were significant positive correlations between morphological and geographical distances and between morphological and genetic distances. It is hypothesized that genetic differentiation might directly affect variability of the stridulatory apparata which would also be indirectly influenced and constrained by external morphological traits (like the width of the coxa and body size). Stridulatory organs, in turn, would affect the ways a few stridulatory traits (especially the temporal ones) change in time and space.",distress signals;body size;stridulatory apparatus;population variability,POPULATION ECOLOGY,2004,APR,Article,English,Ecology

In this study, we developed a software program ``Waveman{''} and prepared a reference library using over 880 audio-files from 36 Asian bat species.

The objective of the latter is the evaluation of the performance of the WT-FD filter on different types of bioacoustic signals, varying not only in their structural morphology but also in the degree of their noise contamination. As it is thoroughly described in Part I of this paper, the WT-FD filter uses the fractal dimension to form an efficient way of thresholding the WT coefficients at different resolution scales, keeping, thus, only those that can contribute to the accurate reconstruction of the ELS and EBS signals. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the experimental results show an efficient performance of the WT-FD filter to circumvent the noise presence (100\% detectability rate, 100\% sensitivity, 100\% specificity) by faithfully extracting the authentic structure of ELS and EBS from the background noise. The WT-FD filter does not require any noise reference signal or noise reference templates. The results from a noise stress test (mean cross-correlation index of the original and the estimated signal converging to 100\%; mean normalized maximum amplitude error converging to 0.7\%) prove its robustness to various noise levels (0-20 dB), enabling its potential use in similar noise cases met in everyday clinical medicine. Furthermore, the efficient performance of the WT-FD filter facilitates the physician to better interpret the auscultation findings. Due to its simplicity and low computational cost, the WT-FD filter can possibly be implemented in a real-time context to serve as a tool for the continuous ELS and EBS screening.",bowel sounds;explosive character;fractal dimension thresholding;lung sounds;noise reduction;structure extraction;wavelet transform,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,2005,JUN,Article,English,"Engineering, Biomedical"

Breeding success is limiting their recoveries and nest monitoring is challenging, but vocal recordings might provide valuable long-term information hard to obtain otherwise. We recorded daily vocal activity at wild nests of both cockatoos using autonomous sound recorders. Combined with behavioural observations and video footage, we identified vocalisations characteristic of six behavioural contexts at nests: birds in flight, while perched, during begging (adult females), during courtship displays (adult males), when entering or sitting near to the nest hollow entrance (adult females), and from nestlings. Linear discriminant analysis on 12 acoustic measurements correctly classified 58.4\% of calls of the red-tailed black cockatoo (n = 907 calls from eight nests) and 62.9\% of calls of the glossy black cockatoo (n = 1632 calls from 11 nests). In both subspecies, the female nest call and nestling calls are the most conspicuous vocal indicators of active nesting, and therefore should be considered for their bioacoustic potential.

During the last decade, three-axial accelerometers have been used to mainly describe diel activity patterns, circadian rhythms and rate of energy consumption of different lobster species, but these devices can also record sound emission in terms of mechanical vibration of carapace. In order to evaluate the efficiency of accelerometers in recording sound production (rasp events and number of pulses inside each rasp) and in discriminating of that from other behavioural events, accelerometers were used in combination with hydrophone and during mesocosm free ranging conditions. Three-axial accelerometers were able to detect sound production events in P. elephas. All the rasp events (n = 405) recorded with hydrophones were also detected by the accelerometers considering its data sampled at different frequency (from 800 Hz to 12 Hz). However, the detection of the number of pulses within each rasp sound decreased with sampling frequency of accelerometer data (median of predictive error for 800 Hz = 0.33; median of predictive error for 12 Hz = 0.65). During mesocosm free condition, three behavioural categories were identified: walk, tail flip, and rasp, the last with averaged (15.16 +/- 3.52 m/s(2)) and maximum (29.49 +/- 9.37 m/s(2)) values of acceleration significantly higher than the other two. Findings from this study prove that accelerometers register only lobster body vibrations providing a clear signal that is not distorted by other noises in the environment. They also allowed to identify rasps for each tagged lobster, something not possible using hydrophones in both, aquaria or natural habitat.

Specifically, while periods of global cooling may have led to fragmentation and differentiation at colder latitudes, they may - at the same time - have led to connectivity among insular patches of montane tropical habitat with unknown consequences on diversification. In the present study we utilized similar to 5.5 kb of DNA sequence data from eight nuclear loci and one mitochondrial gene alongside diagnostic morphological and bioacoustic markers to test the effects of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations on diversification in a complex of Andean tyrant-flycatchers of the genus Elaenia. Results: Population genetic and phylogenetic approaches coupled with coalescent simulations demonstrated disparate levels of gene flow between the taxon chilensis and two parapatric Elaenia taxa predominantly during the last glacial period but not thereafter, possibly on account of downward shifts of montane forest habitat linking the populations of adjacent ridges. Additionally, morphological and bioacoustic analyses revealed a distinct pattern of character displacement in coloration and vocal traits between the two sympatric taxa albiceps and pallatangae, which were characterized by a lack of gene flow. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that global periods of cooling are likely to have facilitated gene flow among Andean montane Elaenia flycatchers that are more isolated from one another during warm interglacial periods such as the present era. We also identify a hitherto overlooked case of plumage and vocal character displacement, underpinning the complexities of gene flow patterns caused by Pleistocene climate change across the Andes.",albiceps complex;Ice age;MP-EST;{*}BEAST;Fastsimcoal,BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,2017,SEP 1,Article,English,Evolutionary Biology;Genetics \& Heredity

10.1002/ece3.4088,Weather conditions determine attenuation and speed of sound: Environmental limitations for monitoring and analyzing bat echolocation,"Goerlitz,HolgerR.",Max Planck Society,"Echolocating bats are regularly studied to investigate auditory-guided behaviors and as important bioindicators. Bioacoustic monitoring methods based on echolocation calls are increasingly used for risk assessment and to ultimately inform conservation strategies for bats. As echolocation calls transmit through the air at the speed of sound, they undergo changes due to atmospheric and geometric attenuation. Both the speed of sound and atmospheric attenuation, however, are variable and determined by weather conditions, particularly temperature and relative humidity. Changing weather conditions thus cause variation in analyzed call parameters, limiting our ability to detect, and correctly analyze bat calls. Here, I use real-world weather data to exemplify the effect of varying weather conditions on the acoustic properties of air. I then present atmospheric attenuation and speed of sound for the global range of weather conditions and bat call frequencies to show their relative effects. Atmospheric attenuation is a nonlinear function of call frequency, temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure. While atmospheric attenuation is strongly positively correlated with call frequency, it is also significantly influenced by temperature and relative humidity in a complex nonlinear fashion. Variable weather conditions thus result in variable and unknown effects on the recorded call, affecting estimates of call frequency and intensity, particularly for high frequencies. Weather-induced variation in speed of sound reaches up to about +/- 3\%, but is generally much smaller and only relevant for acoustic localization methods of bats. The frequency- and weather-dependent variation in atmospheric attenuation has a threefold effect on bioacoustic monitoring of bats: It limits our capability (1) to monitor bats equally across time, space, and species, (2) to correctly measure frequency parameters of bat echolocation calls, particularly for high frequencies, and (3) to correctly identify bat species in species-rich assemblies or for sympatric species with similar call designs.",acoustic tracking;automatic species identification;call analysis;Chiroptera;environmental variation;ranging accuracy,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2018,MAY,Article,English,Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

Herein, molecular, morphological, and bioacoustic evidence are combined to assess species limits within D. parviceps, a widely distributed species in the Amazon Basin. Phylogenetic relationships were assessed using 3040 bp sequences of mitochondrial DNA, genes 12S, ND1, and CO1. The phylogeny shows three well-supported clades. Bioacoustic and morphological divergence is congruent with those clades demonstrating that Dendropsophus parviceps is a species complex. Dendropsophus parviceps sensu stricto occurs in the Amazon basin of Ecuador, northern Peru, southern Colombia and northwestern Brazil. It is sister to two previously undescribed species, D. kubricki sp. n. from central Peru and D. kamagarini sp. n. from southern Peru, northeastern Bolivia, and northwestern Brazil. Genetic distances (uncorrected p, gene 12S) between D. parviceps and the new species is 3 to 4\%. Dendropsophus kamagarini sp. n. can be distinguished from D. parviceps by having a prominent conical tubercle on the distal edge of the upper eyelid (tubercle absent in D. parviceps). Dendropsophus kubricki sp. n. differs from D. parviceps by having scattered low tubercles on the upper eyelids (smooth in D. parviceps). Dendropsophus parviceps and both new species differ from all their congeners by their small size (adult maximum SVL = 28.39 mm in females, 22.73 mm in males) and by having a bright orange blotch on the hidden areas of the shanks and under arms. The advertisement call of the two new species has lower dominant frequency relative to D. parviceps. Probable speciation modes are discussed.

Long-term monitoring programs have reported earlier occurrence of spring activity, reflecting species response to climate change. Although tracking shifts in spring migration represents a valuable approach to monitoring community-level consequences of climate change, robust long-term observations are challenging and costly. Audio recordings and metrics of bioacoustic activity could provide an effective method for monitoring changes in songbird activity and broader biotic interactions. We used 3years of spring and fall recordings at six sites in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, an area experiencing rapid warming and glacial retreat, to examine the utility of bioacoustics to detect changes in songbird phenology. We calculated the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), an algorithm representing an index of bird community complexity. Abrupt changes in ACI values from winter to spring corresponded to spring transition, suggesting that ACI may be an effective, albeit coarse metric to detect the arrival of migrating songbirds. The first peak in ACI shifted from April 16 to April 11 from 2012 to 2014. Changes in ACI were less abrupt in the fall due to weather events, suggesting spring recordings are better suited to indicate phenology. To ensure changes in ACI values were detecting real changes in songbird activity, we explored the relationship between ACI and song of three species: varied thrush(Ixoreus naevius), Pacific wren (Troglodytes pacificus), and ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula). ACI was positively related to counts of all species, but most markedly with song of the varied thrush, the most common species in our recordings and a known indicator of forest ecosystem health. We conclude that acoustic recordings paired with bioacoustic indices may be a useful method of monitoring shifts in songbird communities due to climate change and other sources of anthropogenic disturbance.",Acoustic Complexity Index;Alaska;climate change;Glacier Bay;monitoring;songbirds;soundscape,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2016,JUL,Article,English,Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

The ten currently recognized species of the genus have been divided in two species groups, roseus and vertebralis, but most of them, eight, belong to the roseus group. Recent phylogeographic and phylogenetic studies have suggested that species diversity of the roseus group could be underestimated. An examination of the literature shows that species of the roseus group exhibit high levels of variation in their external characteristics, particularly those used as diagnostic characters, which compromises their taxonomy and hinders their field recognition. High levels of variation were also observed in several new populations of the roseus group discovered in southern Chile (36 degrees - 40 degrees S), which could not be identified to the species level by their external characteristics. On the other hand, the literature reveals a scarse karyotype differentiation and a high bioacoustic uniformity among the species of the roseus group. We performed a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear genes to reevaluate the species diversity of the roseus group, including all the nominal species of Eupsophus and new populations. This analysis was complemented with three species delimitation approaches, General Mixed Yule Coalescent, multi-rate Poisson Tree Process and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery. We favored a conservative delimitation of only four species for the roseus group, a result more consistent with the distribution of pairwise genetic distances, and the available chromosome and bioacoustic evidence. The four recognized lineages, which have nearly completely allopatric distributions, are named after the earliest nominal species that they include, but because high levels of phenotypic variation, they are not diagnosable by consistent differences in external morphology. We discuss the implications of this new proposal for the taxonomy and conservation of the genus, and the possible causes of the difficulty to estimate its species diversity.",,PLOS ONE,2017,AUG 15,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

Earlier studies using allozymes and mitochondrial DNA defined two genetic groups of tdngara frogs, one ranging from Mexico to northern Costa Rica (northern group), the second ranging from Panama to northern South America (southern group). Our more fine-scale survey also shows that the northern and southern tungara frogs are genetically different and geographically separated by a gap in the distribution in central Pacific Costa Rica. Genetic differences among populations are highly correlated with geographic distances. Temporal call parameters differed among populations as well as between genetic groups. Differences in calls were explained better by geographic distance than by genetic distance. Phonotaxis experiments showed that females preferred calls of males from their own populations over calls of males from other populations in about two-thirds to three-fourths of the contrasts tested. In mating experiments, females and males from the same group and females from the north with males from the south produced nests and tadpoles. In contrast, females from the south did not produce nests or tadpoles with males from the north. Thus, northern and southern tungara frogs have diverged both genetically and bioacoustically. There is evidence for some prezygotic isolation due to differences in mate recognition and fertilization success, but such isolation is hardly complete. Our results support the general observation that significant differences in sexual signals are often not correlated with strong genetic differentiation.",bioacoustic variation;genetic variation;microsatellites;Physalaemus pustulosus;reproductive isolation;Tungara frogs,EVOLUTION,2006,AUG,Article,English,Ecology;Evolutionary Biology;Genetics \& Heredity

Single unit activity was recorded extracellularly in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus in house mouse females. In the first part, the neuronal sensitivity to acoustic signals simulating spectral localization cues (notch noise with different bandwidths) was studied. Evaluation of neuronal response variability depending on notch bandwidths revealed that the 1/3 octave notch bandwidth was optimal for the analysis of the localization-significant spectral information. This notch bandwidth corresponded to the average critical bandwidth of the auditory midbrain neurons determined previously by the narrow-band masking method. In the second part, the selectivity of neuronal responses to a discomfort-signaling mouse pup wriggling call, its models and frequency components, was evaluated. The data obtained demonstrated that the wriggling call models with frequency components located, like in a natural call, in three non-overlapping critical bands evoked stronger neuronal responses than the other models.

Many species perform complex ecological roles in plant life cycles by pollinating many plants and consuming dead tissues or acting as predators to pests and therefore having a vital part in shaping our ecosystem. Certain species have a direct economic benefit, e.g. bees and silkworms, while many others cause extensive damage on stored products, crops and plantations by feeding on grain, leaves or fruits. At the top of the hazard scale a few parasitic species transmit harmful viruses that cause serious illnesses and even death to humans, pets and livestock. To understand and assess the impact of insects one needs to have a picture of species existence, spatial distribution and population density. Our discussion on classifying flying insects is based on the recordings of novel advanced sensors and highly accurate classification techniques. The ultimate goal is to embed the classification module in insect traps and form a wireless network of species counting. This work focuses on the classification of insects based solely on their wingflap during flight.

Gephyromantis ceratophrys (AHL, 1929) is resurrected from the synonymy of G. asper and refers to the southernmost populations previously assigned to that species (i. e., from Ranomafana National Park in the southern central east of Madagascar). We provide several new geographical records verified by molecular sequence identity: G. asper is confirmed from the localities Anjozorobe, Mandraka, and Tsinjoarivo; G. spinifer is confirmed from Pic Ivohibe, a record previously considered questionable and representing the northernmost locality known for this species; G. ambohitra is recorded from the Masoala Peninsula, extending its known distribution range eastward; and G. tahotra (previously only known from its type locality Marojejy) is confirmed for the Tsaratanana and Sorata Massifs.

We have identified 253 loci, which included taxon-specific markers for S. major and S. etythrogeays as well as markers for geographic populations. Estimation of genetic diversity and construction of phylogenetic relationships were performed using software programs POPGENE, TEPGA, and TREECON. In all, based on morphological traits, animals from the Tobol-Ishim interfluve were assigned to the two parental morphotypes and showed similar levels of genetic variability (H, n(a), n(e)). However, the total polymorphism level proved to be higher in ground squirrels with the major morphotype (P = 40.32\%, P-95 = 27.27\%) than in animals with the eqthrogenys morphotype (P = 32\%, P-95 = 22.13\%). Nevertheless, the number of rare alleles was high in both cases, constituting about 70\% of the total number. Interpopulation differentiation was considerably higher in S. major (delta = 0.50) than in S. erythrogenys (delta = 0.41). The genetic differentiation between local samples from the Tobol-Ishim interfluvial area was lower than that between the parental species. A significant part of the genetic diversity of the species examined and animals from the zone of overlapping ranges was accounted for by intrapopulation variability. Animals from the northern and southern parts of the Tobol-Ishim interfluve were characterized by the core traits of S. major and S. erythrogenys, respectively, falling into two distinct clusters in the UPGMA and NJ reconstructions. In addition to three hybrid individuals, identified by the bioacoustic method, three hybrid animals were distinguished using RAPID analysis.

Fish sonic muscles in many species rank among the fastest in vertebrates, suggesting that acoustic signalling is a costly activity. Surprisingly however, sound production in the oyster toadfish Opsanus tau requires negligible oxygen consumption. Male toadfish produce a long-duration tonal advertisement call, the boat-whistle, and both sexes produce short-duration agonistic grunt calls. The question of what limits the calling activity in fishes has not been addressed. We tested the hypothesis that calling in the oyster toadfish is limited by fatigue of the sonic muscles by stimulating them intermittently at the most rapid rate evoked by playbacks of the courtship boatwhistle call (100 ms every 4 s at 200 Hz = 1.5 s stimulation/min) for 5 min and measured swimbladder movement, sound production and glycogen use. Muscles in both sexes showed almost complete fatigue by 5 min (7.5 s of stimulation), although rested control muscles contained over twice as much glycogen in males as in females. Glycogen use was similar in both sexes, but males used 10.8\% of their glycogen and females used 23.2\%. Glycogen would support muscle contraction at this rate for 15 min in males during mating call production. It appears that sound production in the oyster toadfish is fatigue limited, which dictates a low rate of spontaneous calling that can be elevated for brief bursts of activity.

These surveys yield large amounts of data, the analysis of which is time consuming and can account for a substantial proportion of the survey budget. Semi-automatic processes enable the bulk of processing to be conducted automatically while allowing analyst time to be reserved for validating and correcting detections and classifications. Existing modules within the Passive Acoustic Monitoring software PAMGuard were used to process a large (25.4 Terabyte) dataset collected during towed acoustic ship transits. The recently developed `Multi-Hypothesis Tracking Click Train Detector' and the `Whistle and Moan Detector' modules were used to identify occasions within the dataset at which vocalising toothed whales (odontocetes) were likely to be acoustically present. These putative detections were then reviewed by an analyst, with false positives being corrected. Target motion analysis provided a perpendicular distance to odontocete click events enabling the estimation of detection functions for both sperm whales and delphinids. Detected whistles were assigned to the lowest taxonomical level possible using the PAMGuard `Whistle Classifier' module. After an initial tuning process, this semi-automatic method required 91 hr of an analyst's time to manually review both automatic click train and whistle detections from 1,696 hr of survey data. Use of the `Multi-Hypothesis Tracking Click Train Detector' reduced the amount of data for the analyst to search by 74.5\%, while the `Whistle and Moan Detector' reduced data to search by 85.9\%. In total, 443 odontocete groups were detected, of which 55 were from sperm whale groups, six were from beaked whales, two were from porpoise and the remaining 380 were identified to the level of delphinid group. An effective survey strip half width of 3,277 and 699 m was estimated for sperm whales and delphinids respectively. The semi-automatic workflow proved successful, reducing the amount of analyst time required to process the data, significantly reducing overall project costs.

Acoustic parameters of echolocation pulses can vary with the context in which they are emitted, and also with the individual and across populations as a whole. The acoustic parameters of social vocalizations, or ``calls{''}, also vary with the individual and context, but not much is known about their variation across populations at different geographic locations. Here, we leveraged the detailed acoustic classification of social vocalizations available for the Great Himalayan leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros armiger, to examine geographic variation in five commonly emitted simple syllable types. We hypothesized that individuals within geographically dispersed populations communicate using spectrographically similar constructs or ``syllable types{''}. We also examined whether call syllables vary discordantly with the correlation pattern observed for echolocation pulses across those same geographic regions. Furthermore, we postulated that the acoustic boundaries of a syllable type are not uniquely constrained to its variation within a particular population of the same subspecies. To test our hypotheses, we obtained recordings of social calls of H. a. armiger from nine locations within the oriental region. These locations were consolidated into five geographic regions based on previously established region-specific differences in the peak frequency of echolocation pulses. A multivariate cluster analysis established that unlike echolocation pulses, syllable types exhibit a relatively large variance. Analysis of this variance showed significant differences in Least Squares Means estimates, establishing significant population-level differences in the multiparametric means of individual syllable types across geographic regions. Multivariate discriminant analysis confirmed the presence of region-specific centroids for different syllable constructs, but also showed a large overlap of their multiparametric boundaries across geographic regions. We propose that despite differences in the population-specific core construct of a syllable type, bats maximize acoustic variation across individuals within a population irrespective of its overflow and overlap with other populations.",bioacoustic signals;social communication;echolocating bats;population divergence;vocalizations;dialects;geographic variation;speech,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2022,JUL 27,Article,English,Ecology

Many methods for computing similarity have been developed, but their performance has not been extensively characterized in noisy environments and with vocalizations characterized by complex frequency modulations. This paper describes methods of bioacoustic comparison based on dynamic time warping (DTW) of the fundamental frequency or spectrogram. Fundamental frequency is estimated using a Bayesian particle filter adaptation of harmonic template matching. The methods were tested on field recordings of flight calls from superb starlings, Lamprotornis superbus, for how well they could separate distinct categories of call elements (motifs). The fundamental-frequency-based method performed best, but the spectrogram-based method was less sensitive to noise. Both DTW methods provided better separation of categories than spectrographic cross correlation, likely due to substantial variability in the duration of superb starling flight call motifs.

After the implantation of cement and the inoculation of Staphylococcas aureus into the bilateral hips of rabbits, ultrasound (average intensity, 300 mW/cm(2); frequency, 46.5 kHz; on/off ratio, 20 min/10 min) was applied to animals in the normal ultrasound group (UG(0-12)) from 0 through 12 h after surgery and to those in the delayed-ultrasound group (UG(12-24)) from 12 through 24 h after surgery. The control group (CG) was not exposed to ultrasound. Based on vancomycin concentrations in left hip cavities at projected time intervals, the amount of time during which the local drug concentration exceeded the MIC (T->MIC) in UG(12-24) was significantly prolonged compared with that in either CG or UG(0-12), and the ratios between the areas under the concentration-time curves over 24 h and the MIC for UG(0-12) and UG(12-24) were both increased compared with that for CG. The greatest reductions in bacterial densities in both right hip aspirates and right femoral tissues at 48 h were achieved with UG(12-24). Local hemorrhage in rabbits of UG(0-12) during the 12-h insonation was more severe than that in rabbits of UG(12-24). Of four variables, the T->MIC and the bioacoustic effect were both identified as parameters predictive of the enhancement of the antimicrobial efficacy of cement by ultrasound. Sustained concentrations above the MIC replaced early high maximum concentrations and long-term subtherapeutic release of the drug, provided that ultrasound was not applied until local hemorrhage was relieved. The enhancement of the antimicrobial efficacy of cement by ultrasound may be attributed to the prolonged T->MIC and the bioacoustic effect caused by ultrasound.",,ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY,2007,SEP,Article,English,Microbiology;Pharmacology \& Pharmacy

We applied laboratory techniques to isolate archival DNA from the three old, liquid-preserved, name-bearing type specimens and conducted target-enriched DNA sequencing of a fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene as basis for the revision of their taxonomy. Along with 16S sequences of 161 fresh samples, sequences of a fragment of the nuclear-encoded Rag-1 gene for 97 of these samples, a multi-gene data set of selected samples, and a comprehensive analysis of available advertisement call recordings, the new data suggest a novel taxonomic hypothesis: (1) The name G. plicifer applies to a highland clade of populations from the southern Central East, previously referred to as Gephyromantis sp. Ca21, with G. sculpturatus as a junior synonym. (2) The name G. luteus applies to a widespread clade distributed along most of Madagascar's eastern rainforest band, and more specifically, is assigned to a subclade occurring mostly in coastal regions of the northern Central East and North East. (3) Large-sized specimens from Ranomafana (southern Central East) and Andohahela (South East) previously considered to belong to G. plicifer in fact represent a hitherto undescribed species, which we here formally name as G. pedronoi sp. nov. The three species are distinguished by very high genetic distances (over 8 \% in the 16S gene), an absence of haplotype sharing in Rag-1, as well as morphological and bioacoustic characteristics. Moreover, several infra-specific clades with 16S divergences > 4 \% may represent distinct species, especially within the widespread G. luteus, but cannot be unambiguously delimited by available data.

Fish were abundant in intermediate (30-90m) layers around the inner front or the northern edge of Pribilof Canyon, while plankton were abundant in deep (> 90 m) layers around the northern edge of Pribilof Canyon or the shelf-break front. In each year, murres foraged around the inner front or the northern edge of Pribilof Canyon, which had high productivity and abundant fish, as has been revealed previously. Non-linear regression analysis on the vertical distribution of prey and distribution of murres suggested that murres especially targeted on fishes concentrated in intermediate layers below the thermocline. Furthermore, comparison of abundance and distribution of prey revealed that fish abundance was lower and distributed in deeper layers in 2005 than in 2003 and 2004.

The six currently valid nominal species are rainforest frogs known from few individuals, hampering a full understanding of the species diversity of the clade. We assembled data on specimens collected during field surveys over the past 30 years and integrated analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded genes of 88 individuals, a comprehensive bioacoustic analysis, and morphological comparisons to delimit a minimum of nine species-level lineages in the subgenus. To clarify the identity of the species Gephyromantis malagasius, we applied a target-enrichment approach to a sample of the 110 year old holotype of Microphryne malagasia Methuen and Hewitt, 1913 to assign this specimen to a lineage based on a mitochondrial DNA barcode. The holotype clustered unambiguously with specimens previously named G. ventrimaculatus. Consequently we propose to consider Trachymantis malagasia ventrimaculatus Angel, 1935 as a junior synonym of Gephyromantis malagasius.

However, identification of calls collected at large scales is hindered by substantial variation within and between species, and the considerable time investment needed to manually identify acoustic data. We use acoustic data from 14 species of echolocating bats, occurring in temperate forests and woodlands of southeastern Australia to build a supervised classification model that identifies species from large acoustic datasets. Acoustic data from hand-release (39,567) and free-flying (8851) bat calls were used to build a predictive model, which was then validated using field-collected calls (149,097) from the same region. We maximized the model fit per species by validating the associated confidence scores against manually identified presence and absence values. This allowed us to model the identification success of each species as a function of the confidence score. From this relationship, we set specific thresholds for accepting species identification, enabling more accurate classification of calls and identification of multiple bat species within a single acoustic recording. Including calls from manually identified free-flying bats improved overall identification accuracy, including a 60\% improvement for bats that navigate in open spaces. Assigning species-specific thresholds achieved substantial improvements in overall model confidence, with functionally meaningful changes in the identification of species exhibiting considerable acoustic overlap in time and frequency measures. Research into the ecological requirements of species is hampered by problems with identification. Our research illustrates that internal train-test validation overestimates model accuracy particularly for species that were in low abundance or for uncommon species, which are acoustically similar to more common ones. Recognizing this, we set specific thresholds per species below which identifications were not accepted. Our method is particularly relevant in locations with high overlap in species' call parameters, which can result in false negatives in preference for species that are easier to identify because of the common practice of assigning one species per acoustic recording. This research proposes a cautious method to substantially reduce the burden of manual identification of large acoustic datasets.",acoustic monitoring;Australia;bats;bioacoustic monitoring;landscape studies;random forest;semiautomated identification;threshold,ECOSPHERE,2022,NOV,Article,English,Ecology

The terminal taxa of the ring (major and minor sectors) are supposed to be reproductively isolated in a zone of secondary contact in the middle Amur valley, Siberia. Our study combines molecular markers (cytochrome-b), bioacoustic analyses and morphological characters to judge the ring species status of the great tit complex. Despite a notable percentage of intermediately coloured birds in the mixed population of middle Amur, a lack of mitochondrial introgression between the major and minor sectors and a small number of true hybrids among voucher specimens from this area suggest at least a partial reproductive barrier between both sectors. In contrast, variation of morphological and especially acoustic characters along the ring-shaped area and the phylogenetic structure of the R major group do not match the ring species concept. Bioacoustic and molecular data (cytochrome-b sequences) reveal two large and closely related subspecies blocks, the sectors major and bokharensis in the Western Palaearctic and central Asia, and the sectors minor and cinereus in the Eastern Palaearctic and South-east Asia, respectively. The two western sectors diverged only recently (0.5 Mya) and they were separated from the eastern group by Pleistocene events about 1.5 Mya. Songs from allopatric regions of the two subspecies blocks differ distinctly in frequency parameters and element composition. In the area of secondary contact, males of all phenotypes share the same frequency range of song, close to the range of the typical minor song. Hybrids and major males sing mixed repertoires of typical major and minor strophe types as well as mixed strophes. In contrast, phenotypic minor males display only pure minor strophes. Differences in mate choice and mating success based on repertoire size are believed to uphold the reproductive barrier between major and minor birds in the area of sympatry. Taxonomic consequences suggest three separate species in the Parus major complex: Parus major s.s. (including the very closely related bokharensis sector), Parus minor and Parus cinereus.

These recently described cryptic taxa have been differentiated primarily based on molecular markers and associated a posteriori morphological characters that corroborate the different clades. Members of this Old World genus are notably conservative in morphology across their range. Several sites on Madagascar hold up to four small-bodied taxa of this genus that are morphologically similar to one another, although they can be distinguished based on the tragus, an ear structure associated with echolocation. Miniopterus often emit species-specific calls. In the present study, we analyze the bioacoustics of the 11 species of Miniopterus currently recognized from the Malagasy region, with an initial identification of the 87 recorded and collected individuals based on molecular markers and certain morphological characters. In most cases, bioacoustic parameters differentiate species and have taxonomic utility. Miniopterus griveaudi populations, which occur on three islands (Madagascar, Anjouan, and Grande Comore), showed no significant differences in peak echolocation frequencies. After running a discriminant function analysis based on five bioacoustic parameters, some mismatched assignments of Malagasy species were found, which include allopatric sister-taxa and sympatric, phylogenetically not closely-related species of similar body size. Because the peak echolocation frequencies of two species (Miniopterus sororculus and Miniopterus aelleni) were independent of body size, they were acoustically distinguishable from cryptic sympatric congeners. The small variation around the allometric relationship between body size and peak echolocation frequency of Malagasy Miniopterus species suggests that intraspecific communication rather than competition or prey detection may be the driver for the acoustic divergence of these two species. Our well-defined echolocation data allow detailed ecological work to commence aiming to test predictions about the relative roles of competition, prey availability, and social communication on the evolution of echolocation in Malagasy Miniopterus species.

All choruses were affected by one or more environmental variables including temperature and moonlight, the latter of which had a significant influence on the timing and received sound levels.

Hence, we studied six freely hovering Anna's hummingbirds, performing acoustic nearfield holography using a 2176 microphone array in vivo, while also directly measuring the 3D aerodynamic forces using a new aerodynamic force platform. We corroborate the acoustic measurements by developing an idealized acoustic model that integrates the aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics, which shows how the timbre of the hummingbird's hum arises from the oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. Comparing birds and insects, we find that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of their flapping wings originates from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces that support their bodyweight. Our model analysis across insects and birds shows that allometric deviation makes larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder, while also clarifying complex bioacoustic behavior.",,ELIFE,2021,MAR 16,Article,English,Biology

We reviewed published literature concerning anuran species which inhabit China, and tested the general relationship between anuran acoustic organs and altitude. The result showed that both the vocal sac and the tympanum had a significantly negative trend to altitude, and that the vocal sac also significantly correlated to the tympanum. The interaction by phylogenetic relationships could be excluded. We suggested that anuran acoustic organs decline with increasing altitude. With increasing altitude, lower population density, low temperature, hypoxia and food shortage could be responsible for such degeneration.

The scientific goal of my bioacoustic research is to determine which fishes produce species-specific sound patterns exclusively with explicit acts of courtship and mating. This provides scientific insight into evolutionary and ecological processes and also provides data necessary to develop the passive acoustic detection technology for monitoring fish reproduction. When used on a daily basis, rebreathers, in my experience, are economical and as practical as open circuit scuba. This is based both on the costs of diving as well as the efficiency of gathering useful data.. The use of open, circuit SCUBA while conducting acoustic recordings results in a loss of at least 40\% of the data due to the bubble noise from a divers breathing.

Speech provides a mechanism for expressing emotions, by both what words are spoken and by the melody or intonation of speech (prosody). Through the perception of variations in prosody, an individual can detect changes in another's emotional state. Prosodic features of mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), indicated by changes in frequency and amplitude, also convey information. Dams retrieve pups that emit separation calls, females approach males emitting solicitous calls, and mice can become fearful of a cue associated with the vocalizations of a distressed conspecific. Because acoustic features of mouse USVs respond to drugs and genetic manipulations that influence reward circuits, USV analysis can be employed to examine how genes influence social motivation, affect regulation, and communication. The purpose of this review is to discuss how genetic and developmental factors influence aspects of the mouse vocal repertoire and how mice respond to the vocalizations of their conspecifics. To generate falsifiable hypotheses about the emotional content of particular calls, this review addresses USV analysis within the framework of affective neuroscience (e.g. measures of motivated behavior such as conditioned place preference tests, brain activity and systemic physiology). Suggested future studies include employment of an expanded array of physiological and statistical approaches to identify the salient acoustic features of mouse vocalizations.

Toothed whales, such as dolphins and porpoises, may manipulate directional beams by simply deforming their foreheads. However, existing materials face great challenges in realizing their bioacoustic function. Here, we propose a bioinspired semianalytical conformal acoustics that can predict the evolution of acoustic functions strictly. Based on this method, we design a series of acoustic steering and collimation models. The sound-speed distribution functions can be determined by conformal mappings, and the acoustic-beam steering and expansion are numerically confirmed. We further experimentally fabricate acoustic steering and collimation devices by using metamaterials. The experimental results show good agreement with theoretical predictions. The proposed bioinspired conformal acoustics may bridge the gap between an animal's biosonar and artificial materials, which show potential application value in underwater acoustics, medical ultrasonography, and other related applications.",,PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED,2020,FEB 4,Article,English,"Physics, Applied"

In bioacoustics, bags typically correspond to regions of interest in spectrograms, which are detected after a segmentation stage of the audio recordings. In this paper, we use different dissimilarity measures between bags and explore whether the subsequent application of metric learning/adaptation methods and the construction of dissimilarity spaces allow increasing the classification performance of birdsong recordings. A publicly available bioacoustic data set is used for the experiments. Our results suggest, in the first place, that appropriate dissimilarity measures are those which capture most of the overall differences between bags, such as the modified Hausdorff distance and the mean minimum distance; in the second place, they confirm the benefit from adapting the applied dissimilarity measure as well as the potential further enhancement of the classification performance by building dissimilarity spaces and increasing training set sizes.

,Optimization of acoustic response,"Tinnsten,M;Esping,B;Jonsson,M",Mid-Sweden University,"The expression ``acoustic optimization{''} can be applied to numerous different disciplines within the field of acoustics. From seismic waves, sound in the atmosphere through bioacoustic, psychoacoustics, and room and theater acoustics over shock and vibration in mechanical structures. This paper deals with the latter. Sound generated by vibrating structures is often called noise which is to be minimized. However, not all vibrating structures produce noise, for example the violin is also a vibrating structure that in most people's opinion produces sound called music. In the case of the violin, great effort is made not to minimize but to optimize the sound, i.e. to get the ``right{''} sound out of the structure. Acoustic optimization within this discipline involves automatic changes of structural design variables to obtain minimum or specified sound in specified regions inside or outside the structure. Examples of problem formulations and some theoretical considerations in the field of acoustic optimization in connection with vibrating mechanical structures will be pointed out. Four simple lest cases are included as numerical examples of the method proposed.",,STRUCTURAL OPTIMIZATION,1999,AUG,Article,English,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications;Engineering, Multidisciplinary;Mechanics"

Their social structure consists of pods with unique call repertoires and clans sharing vocal traditions. Call repertoires are typically established visually and aurally and are used for pod identification. Automatic tools are, however, more suited for large data sets. An Icelandic orca pod occurring in 2019 in the Ligurian Sea provided a unique occasion for collecting recordings of an isolated pod in natural conditions. Recordings were analyzed visually and aurally to create a pod catalog. The R package ``warbleR{''} was used for the first time on a small subsample of orca data to automatically detect sound samples and classify sound types. We found cross-correlation methods with the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to successfully classify sound types, though false positives occur. We compared our catalog to Icelandic and Antarctic ones checking for similarities and dissimilarities. We found five matches in the Icelandic catalog, two of which had high PCCs ranges (0.62-0.67; 0.60-0.65). Our automatic approach was limited by background noise and variability of orca vocalizations, and it was computationally demanding.

Most published studies include more than one call per subject into such an analysis. This, in fact, leads to a two-factorial data set that includes the factor `subject' in addition to the factor of interest ( e. g. species, context, or social group). The regular version of the DFA, however, does not allow for the analysis of such data sets without violating the assumption of independence. In this paper, we show that analysing factorial data sets using a conventional DFA is a case of pseudoreplication and tends to produce ( sometimes grossly) incorrect results. In such a case the discriminability of species, contexts or groups etc. can be drastically overestimated. Furthermore, we provide a permutation-based procedure that copes with such data sets.

Whether such differences are result from genetic divergence between urban and rural populations, or from plasticity or cultural evolution of song remains poorly understood.

We investigated whether these differences were associated with corresponding morphological and neutral genetic differences. Across six pairs of geographically separate urban and rural populations, all morphological traits measured were similar. Furthermore, genetic analyses of variation at nine microsatellite loci revealed high levels of genetic connectivity between populations, and similar levels of heterozygosity in both habitat types.

We devised automated signal processing and machine learning approaches to estimate dates on which songbird communities arrived at arctic breeding grounds. Acoustically estimated dates agreed well with those determined via traditional surveys and were strongly related to the landscape's snow-free dates. We found that environmental conditions heavily influenced daily variation in songbird vocal activity, especially before egg laying.

In this paper, a machine learning method is presented to statistically classify avian vocalizations. Automated approaches were applied to isolate bird songs from long field recordings, assess song similarities, and classify songs into distinct variants. Because no positive controls were available to assess the true classification of variants, multiple replicates of automatic classification of song variants were analyzed to investigate clustering uncertainty. The automatic classifications were more similar to the expert classifications than expected by chance. Application of these methods demonstrated the presence of discrete song variants in an island population of the New Zealand hihi (Notiomystis cincta). The geographic patterns of song variation were then revealed by integrating over classification replicates. Because this automated approach considers variation in song variant classification, it reduces potential human bias and facilitates the reproducibility of the results.

Reduced costs and a huge increase in storage capacity of acoustic recorders have resulted in an exponential use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) on a wide range of animal groups in recent years. PAM has led to a rapid growth in the quantity of acoustic data, making manual identification increasingly time-consuming. Therefore, software detecting sound events, extracting numerous features and automatically identifying species have been developed. However, automated identification generates identification errors, which could influence analyses which look at the ecological response of species. Taking the case of bats for which PAM constitutes an efficient tool, we propose a cautious method to account for errors in acoustic identifications of any taxa without excessive manual checking of recordings. We propose to check a representative sample of the outputs of a software commonly used in acoustic surveys (Tadarida), to model the identification success probability of 10 species and two species groups as a function of the confidence score provided for each automated identification. Using this relationship, we then investigated the effect of setting different false positive tolerances (FPTs), from a 50\% to 10\% false positive rate, above which data are discarded, by repeating a large-scale analysis of bat response to environmental variables and checking for consistency in the results. Considering estimates, standard errors and significance of species response to environmental variables, the main changes occurred between the naive (i.e. raw data) and robust analyses (i.e. using FPTs). Responses were highly stable between FPTs. We conclude it was essential to, at least, remove data above 50\% FPT to minimize false positives. We recommend systematically checking the consistency of responses for at least two contrasting FPTs (e.g. 50\% and 10\%), in order to ensure robustness, and only going on to conclusive interpretation when these are consistent. This study provides a huge saving of time for manual checking, which will facilitate the improvement in large-scale monitoring, and ultimately our understanding of ecological responses.",bioacoustic;cautious threshold;chiroptera;error rate;false positives;passive acoustic monitoring;semi-automated identification;survey methods,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2019,AUG,Article,English,Ecology

This discovery is unexpected in one of the largest and most densely populated urban parts of the world. It also demonstrates that new vertebrate species can still be found periodically even in well-studied locales rarely associated with undocumented biodiversity. The new species typically occurs in expansive open-canopied wetlands interspersed with upland patches, but centuries of loss and impact to these habitats give some cause for conservation concern.

Belding's ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) produce alarm chirps that function in predator avoidance but little is known about the acoustic variability of these alarm chirps. The purpose of this preliminary study was to analyze the acoustic structure of alarm chirps with respect to individual differences (e.g., signature information) from eight Belding's ground squirrels from four different lakes in the High Sierra Nevada. Results demonstrate that alarm chirps are individually distinctive, and that acoustic similarity among individuals may correspond to genetic similarity and thus dispersal patterns in this species.

We found two-and three-note types for species with long and short calls, respectively. This acoustic diversity of notes is recurrent in the literature about the acoustic repertoire of the S. catharinae group and may be directly related to a functional diversity. The species S. humilis has a unique call that does not match any of the acoustic patterns described, and the calls of S. agilis resemble calls of another species group, the Scinax ruber group. Additionally, we review the call nomenclature of the group and standardize it according to homology criteria: acoustic similarity, relative position, and connection by intermediate taxa between the call structures analysed.

Comprehensive study on bioacoustic signals indicates the existence of a diversity of non-linear phenomena, such as limit cycles, subharmonics, biphonation, chaos, and bifurcations in animal vocalizations, which may provide keys to understanding animal communications. In this paper, we review the concept of nonlinear dynamics and its methodology as applicable to bioacoustics. Acoustical analysis of recorded sounds, simulation of a biomechanical model of the voice production system, and physical experiment of the vocal tract and vocal folds are presented to demonstrate non-linear features inherent in animal vocalizations. We focus on source filter interaction as one of the main regulators of the non-linear property that can lead either to efficient vocalization or to voice instability in animal sounds.

Audiograms produced in this study expressed in both SPL and particle acceleration showed a positive relationship between hearing threshold and frequency. Micropterus coosae was most sensitive to frequencies that overlap with the peak frequencies of their vocalizations, and the vocalizations of a prey species, Cyprinella trichroistia.

Molecular methods have dramatically improved our ability to uncover cryptic species, but the magnitude of cryptic diversity remains unknown, particularly in diverse tropical regions such as the Amazon Basin. Uncovering cryptic diversity in amphibians is particularly pressing because amphibians are going extinct globally at an alarming rate. Here, we use an integrative analysis of two independent Amazonian frog clades, Engystomops toadlets and Hypsiboas treefrogs, to test whether species richness is underestimated and, if so, by how much. We sampled intensively in six countries with a focus in Ecuador (Engystomops: 252 individuals from 36 localities; Hypsiboas: 208 individuals from 65 localities) and combined mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA, morphological, and bioacoustic data to detect cryptic species. We found that in both clades, species richness was severely underestimated, with more undescribed species than described species. In Engystomops, the two currently recognized species are actually five to seven species (a 150-250\% increase in species richness); in Hypsiboas, two recognized species represent six to nine species (a 200-350\% increase).

We developed novel bioacoustic sampling techniques, based on Fast Fourier Transforms, to increase the precision and sensitivity of male advertisement call analysis and applied the method to European water frogs. This approach robustly separated the three types of north European water frogs (Rana ridibunda, R. lessonae and their viable, fertile hybrid R. esculenta) by their call subunit characteristics. The hybrid frog exhibited a high frequency call component absent from both the parental species. Furthermore, call analysis demonstrated significant intraspecific differences among populations of all three frog types. Call characters of R. ridibunda changed systematically as a function of longitude. This trend may reflect either clinal variation in selection pressures across Europe, or the consequences of drift following postglacial colonization from eastern refugia. High resolution vocalization analysis therefore provides a potentially useful method for investigating intraspecific differentiation and the phylogeographical origins of anuran distributions.

In amphibians, the lack of phenotypic differences between closely-related taxa, their complex, sometimes unresolved phylogenetic relationships, and their potential to hybridize all act to blur taxonomic boundaries. Here we implement a multi-disciplinary approach to evaluate the nature of two deeply-diverged mitochondrial lineages previously documented in Italian tree frogs (Hyla intermedia s. l.), distributed north and south of the Northern Apennine Mountains. Based on evidence from mitochondrial phylogenetics, nuclear phylogenomics, hybrid zone population genomics, niche modeling analyses, and biometric assessments, we propose that these lineages be considered distinct, cryptic species. Both mitochondrial and nuclear data affirm that they belong to two monophyletic clades of Pliocene divergence (similar to 3.5 My), only admixing over a relatively narrow contact zone restricted to the southeast of the Po Plain (50-100 km). These characteristics are comparable to similarly-studied parapatric amphibians bearing a specific status. Inferred from their current geographic distribution, the two Italian tree frogs feature distinct ecological niches (< 15\% of niche overlap), raising questions regarding potential adaptive components contributing to their incipient speciation. However, we found no diagnostic morphological and bioacoustic differences between them. This system illustrates the speciation continuum of Western-Palearctic tree frogs and identifies additional cryptic lineages of similar divergence to be treated as separate species (H. cf. meridionalis). We recommend combined approaches using genomic data as applied here for the future taxonomic assessment of cryptic diversity in alloparapatric radiations of terrestrial vertebrates, especially in controversial taxa.

Using population genomic and comparative genomic methods on 45 whole genomes, including historical reconstructions of effective population size, genomic peaks of differentiation and genomic linkage, we infer that the form affinis is likely the product of a westward expansion in which it replaced a now-extinct congener that was the donor of its mtDNA and small portions of its nuclear genome.

For example, whistling is used as a highly salient signal for capturing attention, and can have iconic cultural meanings such as the catcall, enact a formal code as in boatswain's calls or stand as a proxy for speech in whistled languages. We used real-time magnetic resonance imaging to examine the muscular control of whistling to describe a strong association between the shape of the tongue and the whistled frequency. This bioacoustic profile parallels the use of the tongue in vowel production. This is consistent with the role of whistled languages as proxies for spoken languages, in which one of the acoustical features of speech sounds is substituted with a frequency-modulated whistle. Furthermore, previous evidence that non-human apes may be capable of learning to whistle from humans suggests that these animals may have similar sensorimotor abilities to those that are used to support speech in humans.",whistle;speech;communication;tongue;magnetic resonance imaging;evolution,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,2019,SEP 18,Article,English,Biology;Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

The ``typical{''} snake hiss is described as having a broad-frequency span (from roughly 3,000 to 13,000 Hertz) and a dominant frequency near 7,500 Hertz.

Structural analysis of the upper respiratory tract of O. hannah suggests that the ``growl{''} is produced by tracheal diverticula functioning as low-frequency resonating chambers. This hypothesis is supported in several ways. An acoustic analysis of a mechanical model of the trachea demonstrates the potential for these diverticula to produce resonance effects. A ``growl{''} also occurs in the mangrove ratsnake (Gonyosoma oxycephalum), a species that also has tracheal diverticula.

Invasive species may have devastating impacts on native biota. Cane toads Rhinella marina continue to invade northern Australia and the consequences for the endemic frogs are unclear. Monitoring frogs in such remote areas is difficult because their activity depends heavily on unpredictable rainfall events. 2. We developed an autonomous acoustic monitoring system which used machine learning techniques to identify up to 22 calling species in real time. Ten of these systems, capable of operating for at least a year without attention, were deployed over a 10-year period along the Roper River valley in the Northern Territory, logging more than 4 million records pre- and post-toad invasion. 3. Within 5years of their arrival, cane toads became one of the most prominent members of the anuran community. We detected an overall impact, with six frog species declining in calling activity and one apparently increasing. However, almost all species detected initially were detected at the end of the monitoring period, and again on a follow-up survey after a further 10years. 4. Synthesis and applications. The overall impact of cane toads on endemic frogs has been largely one of rarefaction rather than elimination. Rather than having a devastating impact on the endemic frogs, cane toads have become a component of the amphibian community. Autonomous recording and identification systems such as ours have great potential for long term monitoring of vocalising species in remote and variable environments.",amphibian declines;automated bioacoustic monitoring;cane toads;frog communities;invasive species;long-term monitoring;remote environments,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2017,DEC,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology

The study was designed to represent a snapshot of the male calling activity under low densities of intra-and interspecific competitors and little variation of climatic conditions. We characterized calling sites by measuring the vegetation attributes and flood levels of calling sites occupied by 59 males and comparing them to available microhabitats. We found that males exhibit some degree of selectivity for calling sites, often selecting microhabitats with greater density of vegetation > 50 cm tall. Calling site selection was not affected by water depth or area flooded. Most individuals vocalized in sites near the ground (<= 25 cm), a pattern that is the contrary to that expected to maximize sound propagation. We suggest that, due to the open habitat of the studied area, the choice of calling sites is more related to the need for shelter from predation and avoidance of desiccation and heat loss than to bioacoustic performance.",Behavior;Reproduction;Vegetation;Vocalization;Wetlands,SOUTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY,2016,DEC,Article,English,Zoology

The authors extracted 42 soft forehead tissue samples to estimate the sound velocity and density properties at room temperature, 25.0 C-o. Hounsfield Units (HUs) of the samples were read from CT scans. Linear relationships between the tissues' HUs and velocity, and HUs and density were revealed through regression analyses. The distributions of the head acoustic properties at axial, coronal, and sagittal cross sections were reconstructed, suggesting that the forehead soft tissues were characterized by low-velocity in the melon, high-velocity in the muscle and connective tissues. Further, the sound velocities of melon, muscle, and connective tissue pieces were measured under different temperatures to investigate tissues' velocity response to temperature. The results demonstrated nonlinear relationships between tissues' sound velocity and temperature. This study represents a first attempt to provide general information on acoustic properties of this species.

However, animal vocalization data collection and transcription is a difficult and time-consuming task, so that it is expensive to create large data sets. One natural solution to this problem is the use of acoustic adaptation methods. Such methods, common in human speech recognition systems, create initial models trained on speaker independent data, then use small amounts of adaptation data to build individual-specific models. Since, as in human speech, individual vocal variability is a significant source of variation in bioacoustic data, acoustic model adaptation is naturally suited to classification in this domain as well. To demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, this paper presents the application of maximum likelihood linear regression adaptation to ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana L.) song-type classification. Classification accuracies for the adapted system are computed as a function of the amount of adaptation data and compared to caller-independent and caller-dependent systems. The experimental results indicate that given the same amount of data, supervised adaptation significantly outperforms both caller-independent and caller-dependent systems.

The association can include an understorey of lantana (Lantana camara) preventing eucalypt regeneration. To date, comparatively little is known about the effects of these processes on mammal diversity and abundance. We therefore considered the effects of BMAD and lantana presence on ground mammals and insectivorous bats in four forest sites within New South Wales. These were monitored in association with a restoration project for the treatment of lantana that used glyphosate spraying to kill lantana in half of six 50mx50m quadrats per site (three control and three treated). Passive bioacoustic recorders, infrared cameras and Elliott traps were used to survey understorey fauna over four consecutive nights during each season. We found a greater number of small ground-dwelling and large mammals in control areas with an intact understorey of lantana relative to areas where lantana had been treated. However, insectivorous bats were not influenced by lantana presence. Our results suggest that ground-dwelling mammals benefit from the presence of lantana, as it may provide structural complexity that reduces predation risk and/or provides a food resource.",Antechinus;biodiversity;decline;environment;eucalypt;Trichosurus;weed species,AUSTRALIAN MAMMALOGY,2019,,Article,English,Zoology

Performance evaluation is an important part of employing automated acoustic recognition technology because the resulting data quality can vary with a variety of factors. We reviewed the bioacoustic literature to summarize performance evaluation and found little consistency in evaluation, metrics employed, or terminology used. We also found that few studies examined how score threshold, i. e., cut-off for the level of confidence in target species classification, affected performance, but those that did showed a strong impact of score threshold on performance. We used the lessons learned from our literature review and best practices from the field of machine learning to evaluate the performance of five readily-available automated signal recognition programs. We used the Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor) as our model species because it has simple, consistent, and frequent vocalizations. We found that automated signal recognition was effective for determining Common Nighthawk presence-absence and call rate, particularly at low score thresholds, but that occupancy estimates from the data processed with recognizers were consistently lower than from data generated by human listening and became unstable at high score thresholds. Of the five programs evaluated, our convolutional neural network (CNN) recognizer performed best, with recognizers built in Song Scope and MonitoR also performing well. The RavenPro and Kaleidoscope recognizers were moderately effective, but produced more false positives than the other recognizers. Finally, we synthesized six general recommendations for ecologists who employ automated signal recognition software, including what to use as a test benchmark, how to incorporate score threshold, what metrics to use, and how to evaluate efficiency.

Nearest-neighbor classification using 32-point waveform envelopes yielded 85.7\% recognition rates when Euclidean distances with 8 or 12 FD's were employed. With 4 or 16 FD's, recognition was 82.1\% but dropped to 71.4\% when the number of FD's was reduced to 3. Evidently only the low-order 4 or 5 FD's are required to characterize most signals examined. Four FD's were adequate representation for linear discriminant analysis, wherein 27 (96.1\%) of the samples were classified correctly, and for hierarchical cluster analysis, wherein 26 (92.9\%) of the samples clustered into dendrogram subtrees corresponding to the known sound groups. Two sounds accounted for many errors in the classification experiments, and these differed from typical sounds for their respective species groups. In such cases, more than a single FD reference pattern may be required to adequately represent the sounds of a given species.",,JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,1994,JUN,Article,English,Acoustics;Audiology \& Speech-Language Pathology

Here we use a combination of molecular, bioacoustic and morphometric evidence to describe a new species of Andean poison frog: Andinobates cassidyhornae sp. nov. from the high elevation cloud forests of the Colombian Cordillera Occidental, in the northwestern Andes. The new species is associated to the bombetes group and characterized by a unique combination of ventral and dorsal color patterns. Data on 1119 bp from two mitochondrial markers allowed us to reject the null hypotheses that A. cassidyhornae sp. nov. is part of the phenotypically similar and geographically less distant species: A. opisthomelas, A. virolinensis or A. bombetes. The best available phylogenetic trees and the genetic distance to other Andinobates species further support this decision. Altogether, the advertisement call parameters unambiguously separated A. cassidyhornae sp. nov. calls from the calls of the three closest species.

In the seabird family Sulidae, boobies show dramatic sexual dimorphism in their vocalizations, and gannet calls have also been suggested to be dimorphic to human observers. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of sexually dimorphic calls in the Australasian gannet (Morus serrator) through the first comprehensive description of its vocalizations recorded at two localities; Cape Kidnappers, where individuals were banded and sexed from DNA samples, and at the Muriwai gannetry, both on the North Island of New Zealand. Calls were first inspected using basic bioacoustic features to establish a library of call element types for general reference. Extensive multivariate tests, based on a dynamic time warping algorithm, subsequently revealed that no sexual differences could be detected in Australasian gannet calls. The analyses, however, indicated extensive and consistent vocal variation between individuals, particularly so in female gannets, which may serve to signal individual identity to conspecifics. This study generates predictions to identify whether differences in Australasian gannet vocalizations play perceptual and functional roles in the breeding and social biology of this long-lived biparental seabird species.

A total of 109 specimens formally belonging to eight species of Scinax and three species of Ololygon were collected in 13 localities along the state of Bahia (northeastern Brazil) and one site in Espirito Santo (southeastern Brazil). Of the Scinax species collected in this study, three were morphologically differentiated from other described species and identified as putative new species (Scinax sp.1, Scinax sp.2 and Scinax sp.3). The species delimitations were inferred using three different methods: ABGD, PTP and mPTP which allowed recognizing 11 Scinax species and five Ololygon species.

This study presents evidence for strong phylogeographic structure in two sunbird species from the heart of this region, the olive-backed sunbird, Cinnyris jugularis, and the black sunbird, Leptocoma aspasia. We assessed population divergence using morphological, plumage, bioacoustic and molecular data (mitochondrial ND2/ND3). Our findings indicate that the olive-backed sunbird should be recognized as multiple species, because birds from Sulawesi and the Sahul Shelf are closely related to each other, but widely separated from those in other regions. In addition, we provide evidence for an endemic species on the Wakatobi Islands, an archipelago of deep-sea islands off south-east Sulawesi. That a small bird could exhibit a range all the way from Sulawesi to Australia, while diverging on a small archipelago within this range, illustrates the complex interplay between dispersal and speciation. Our black sunbird genetic data also suggest unrecognized population structure, despite relatively weak plumage divergence. Black sunbirds in Sulawesi are likely to be a separate species from those in New Guinea, with a mean genetic distance of 9.1\%.

Some birds produce repertoires consisting of hundreds of songs while others produce a single song type. For species with a single-song repertoire, there are varying levels of inter-individual variation which can be the result of environmental, genetic, and physiological factors. Male Snow Buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis) typically produce a single song type, and while syllable sharing occurs between individuals, many researchers have anecdotally noted the individuality of each male's song. To investigate this long-held assertion, we performed a detailed bioacoustic analysis of male Snow Buntings recorded in the Canadian Arctic. We use canonical discriminant analysis to provide quantitative evidence confirming that male Snow Buntings sing individually distinctive songs. Furthermore, we present the first evidence that some Snow Buntings exhibit inter-annual variation in song structure; while songs remain consistent within each year, two males changed their song type between years. Inter-individual variation in song content can have important behavioral implications, because it facilitates individual recognition and can affect individual fitness.",individual distinctiveness;individual recognition;inter-annual variation;Plectrophenax nivalis;Snow Bunting;song,WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY,2014,JUN,Article,English,Ornithology

Duration-tuned neurons (DTNs) have since been reported from the central auditory system of both echolocating and non-echolocating mammals, and from the central visual system of cats. We hypothesize that the functional significance of auditory duration tuning likely varies between species with different evolutionary histories, sensory ecologies, and bioacoustic constraints. For example, in non-echolocating animals such as frogs and mice the temporal filtering properties of auditory DTNs may function to discriminate species-specific communication sounds. In echolocating bats duration tuning may also be used to create cells with highly selective responses for specific rates of frequency modulation and/or pulse-echo delays. The ability to echolocate appears to have selected for high temporal acuity in the duration tuning curves of inferior colliculus neurons in bats. Our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying sound duration selectivity has improved substantially since DTNs were first discovered almost 50 years ago, but additional research is required for a comprehensive understanding of the functional role and the behavioral significance that duration tuning plays in sensory systems.",Audition;Duration selectivity;Echolocation;Neurophysiology;Temporal processing,"JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND

Nearly all studies of their acoustic communication focus on sound pressure measurements, overlooking the particle motion components of their communication signals. Here we characterized the levels of acoustic particle velocity (and pressure) of song produced by humpback whales. We demonstrate that whales generate acoustic fields that include significant particle velocity components that are detectable over relatively long distances sufficient to play a role in acoustic communication. We show that these signals attenuate predictably in a manner similar to pressure and that direct particle velocity measurements can provide bearings to singing whales. Whales could potentially use such information to determine the distance of signalling animals. Additionally, the vibratory nature of particle velocity may stimulate bone conduction, a hearing modality found in other low-frequency specialized mammals, offering a parsimonious mechanism of acoustic energy transduction into the massive ossicles of whale ears. With substantial concerns regarding the effects of increasing anthropogenic ocean noise and major uncertainties surrounding mysticete hearing, these results highlight both an unexplored pathway that may be available for whale acoustic communication and the need to better understand the biological role of acoustic particle motion.",acoustic communication;noise;cetacean;bioacoustics;hearing;soundscape,BIOLOGY LETTERS,2016,NOV 1,Article,English,Biology;Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

For organisms that remain active in one of the last undisturbed and pristine dark environments on the planet-the Arctic Polar Night-the moon, stars and aurora borealis may provide important cues to guide distribution and behaviours, including predator-prey interactions. With a changing climate and increased human activities in the Arctic, such natural light sources will in many places be masked by the much stronger illumination from artificial light.

A premium is placed on the subselection of files that will maximize the efficiency of unique additional species identified, to be used for future analyses. Using acoustic data collected in 17 plots, we created 60 subsetting scenarios across three gradients: intensity (minutes in an hour), day phase (dawn, morning, or both), and duration (number of days) for manual annotation. We analyzed the effect of these variables on observed bird species richness and assemblage composition at both the local and entire study area scale. For reference, results were also compared to richness and composition estimated by the traditional point count method. Intensity, day phase, and duration all affected observed richness in decreasing respective order. These variables also significantly affected observed assemblage composition (in the same order of effect size), but only the day phase produced compositional dissimilarity that was due to phenological traits of individual bird species, rather than differences in species richness. All annotation scenarios requiring equal sampling effort to point counts yielded higher species richness than the point count method. Our results show that a great majority of species can be obtained by annotating files at high sampling intensities (every 3 or 6 min) in the morning period (post-dawn) over a duration of two days. Depending on a study's aim, different subsetting parameters will produce different assemblage compositions, potentially omitting rare or crepuscular species, species representing additional functional groups and natural history guilds, or species of higher conservation concern. We do not recommend one particular subsetting regime for all research objectives, but rather present multiple scenarios for researchers to understand how intensity, day phase, and duration interact to identify the best subsetting regime for one's particular research interests.",acoustic survey;annotation;bioacoustic;bird richness and composition;forest birds;passive acoustic monitoring;point count;survey design,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2022,NOV,Article,English,Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

We assessed the influence of different temperature ranges and different body condition ranges over a three-year period of breeding season on the acoustical features of the advertisement calls of 62 individuals. Air temperature had negative relationship with call duration and note number. Body condition had a negative relationship with the dominant frequency and positive effects on pulse number and note duration. The acoustic parameters of S. constrictus were stable across breeding seasons. Temporal parameters were highly variable within individuals, whereas the dominant frequency was the most stereotyped property of advertisement calls. Individuals of S. constrictus have sufficient among-male variability, especially for temporal parameters (call duration, number of notes, and note duration), to permit discrimination between conspecific calling males at a reproductive site by statistical analysis. The results highlight the informativeness of non-invasive bioacoustic features for population-level studies and biological conservation.",acoustic behaviour;acoustic discrimination;Central Brazil;intraspecific variation;temporal variability,AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA,2014,,Article,English,Zoology

I: The chick-a-dee call of the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus),"Charrier,I;Bloomfield,LL;Sturdy,CB",University of Alberta;University of Alberta,"The chick-a-dee call of the black-capped chickadee, Poecile atricapillus (L., 1766), consists of four note types and is used in a wide variety of contexts including mild alarm, contact between mates, and for mobilizing members of winter flocks. Because note-type composition varies with context and because birds need to identify flock mates and individuals by their calls, it is important that birds are able to discriminate between note types and birds. Moreover, previous experiments have shown that black-capped chickadees are able to discriminate their four note types, but the acoustical basis of this process is still unknown. Here, we present the results of a bioacoustic analysis that suggests which acoustic features may be controlling the birds' perception of note types and of individual identity. Several acoustic features show high note type and individual specificity, but frequency and frequency modulation cues (in particular, those of the initial part of the note) appear more likely to be used in these processes. However, only future experiments testing the bird's perceptual abilities will determine which acoustic cues in particular are used in the discrimination of note types and in individual recognition.",,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,2004,MAY,Article,English,Zoology

Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) use signature whistles containing identification information. Past studies have used human participants to gain insight into dolphin perception, but most previous research investigated echolocation. In Experiment 1, human participants were tested on their ability to discriminate among signature whistles from three dolphins. Participants' performance was nearly errorless. In Experiment 2, participants identified signature whistles masked by five different samples of boat noise utilizing different signal-to-noise ratios. Lower signal-to-noise ratio and proximity in frequency between the whistle and noise both significantly decreased performance. Like dolphins, human participants primarily identified whistles using frequency contour. Participants reported greater use of amplitude in noise-present vs noise-absent trials, but otherwise did not vary cue usage. These findings can be used to generate hypotheses about dolphins' performance and auditory cue use for future research.

We report a biogeographic leapfrog pattern in the vocalizations of these birds, and uncover deep genomic divergence among island populations despite the presence of intermittent land connections between some. We demonstrate how rare instances of genetic introgression have affected the evolution of this species complex, and document the presence of double introgressive mitochondrial sweeps, highlighting the dangers of using only mitochondrial DNA in evolutionary research. By applying different tree inference approaches, we demonstrate how concatenation methods can give inaccurate results when investigating divergence in closely-related taxa. Our study highlights high levels of cryptic avian diversity in poorly-explored Wallacea, elucidates complex patterns of Pleistocene climate-mediated diversification in an elusive montane songbird, and suggests that Pleistocene land bridges may have accounted for limited connectivity among montane Wallacean biota.

This study investigates using clicks for species and population identification by characterizing the spectral structure of Risso's dolphin echolocation clicks recorded over wide-ranging geographic regions including the U.S. waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and North Pacific Ocean; and international waters of the Eastern Tropical Pacific. All recordings with Risso's dolphin clicks exhibited the spectral peak and notch pattern described off southern California, indicating the presence of peak banding patterns is useful for species discrimination. Geographic regions were a significant explanatory factor for variability in the frequencies of click spectral peaks, with relatively higher frequency peaks and notches found off Hawaii compared to California waters and off the southeast U.S. compared to the Gulf of Mexico.

The array was attached to a vertical buoy line used to mark each end of a longline fishing set, at 300 m depth, close to the sound-speed minimum of the deep-water profile. The buoy line also served as a depredation decoy, attracting seven sperm whales to the area. One animal was tagged with both a LIMPET dive depth-transmitting satellite and bioacoustic ``B-probe{''} tag. Both tag datasets were used as an independent check of various passive acoustic schemes for tracking the whale in depth and range, which exploited the elevation angles and relative arrival times of multiple ray paths recorded on the array. Analytical tracking formulas were viable up to 2 km range, but only numerical propagation models yielded accurate locations up to at least 35 km range at Beaufort sea state 3. Neither localization approach required knowledge of the local bottom bathymetry.

Nonlinear time resampling of 12 NPRW ``upcalls{''} and 20 ``gunshots{''} recorded in a critical NPRW habitat isolated individual normal mode arrivals from each call. The relative modal arrival times permitted range estimates between 1 and 40 km, while the relative modal amplitudes permitted call depth estimates, provided that environmental inversions were obtained from high signal-to-noise ratio calls. Gunshot sounds were generally only produced at a few meters depth, while upcall depths clustered between 10 and 25 m, consistent with previously published bioacoustic tagging results from North Atlantic right whales. A Wilcoxon rank sum test rejected the null hypothesis that the mean calling depths of the two call types were the same (p = 2.9 x 10(-5)); the null hypothesis was still rejected if the sample set was restricted to one call per acoustic encounter (p = 0.02).

While considered sound-sensitive, their bioacoustic characteristics are relatively poorly studied. The goal of this study was to characterize the vocal repertoire of melon-headed whales to determine whether they produce repeated calls that could assist in recognition of conspecifics. The first tag-based acoustic recordings of three melon-headed whales were analyzed. Tag records were visually and aurally inspected and all calls were individually extracted. Non-overlapping calls with sufficient signal-to-noise were then parameterized and visually grouped into categories of repeated call types. Thirty-six call categories emerged. Categories differed significantly in duration, peak and centroid frequency, and -3 dB bandwidth. Calls of a given type were more likely to follow each other than expected. These data suggest that repeated calls may function in individual, subgroup, or group recognition. Repeated call production could also serve to enhance signal detection in large groups with many individuals producing simultaneous calls. Results suggest that caution should be used in developing automatic classification algorithms for this species based on small sample sizes, as they may be dominated by repeated calls from a few individuals, and thus not representative of species-or population-specific acoustic parameters.

We develop a method to convertbat passes, a measure of acoustic activity, to an estimated number of bats in the roost. To do so, we took audio-visual recordings of fiveMiniopterus schreibersiicolonies emerging from their roosts over 25 nights. We compared the accuracy of the estimates when using site-specific acoustic data against a combined global dataset and examined the influence of the detector position on the estimates. Site-specific acoustic datasets recorded at the cave entrance showed to be adequate to estimate roost bat numbers. In addition, we acoustically monitored one cave during three months of continuous sampling to test our protocol and compared the resulting data with historical datasets of roost occupancy.

Propagation of biological acoustic signals has often been studied in homogeneous environments using an idealized circular active space representation, but few studies have assessed the variations of the active space due to environment heterogeneities and transmitter position. To study these variations for mountain birds like the rock ptarmigan, we developed a sound propagation model based on the parabolic equation method that accounts for the topography, the ground effects, and the meteorological conditions. The comparison of numerical simulations with measurements performed during an experimental campaign in the French Alps confirms the capacity of the model to accurately predict sound levels. We then use this model to show how mountain conditions affect surface and shape of active spaces, with topography being the most significant factor. Our data reveal that singing during display flights is a good strategy to adopt for a transmitter to expand its active space in such an environment.

These systems are useful as echolocation calls give valuable information on bat behaviour and ecology and hence are widely used for research and conservation of bat populations. Despite the challenges associated with automated classifiers, due to the interspecific differences in call characteristics of bat species found in the Maltese Islands, the use of a quantitative and automated approach is investigated. The sound analysis pipeline involved the use of an algorithm to clean sound files from background noise and measure temporal and spectral parameters of bat echolocation calls. These parameters were then fed to a trained and validated artificial neural network using a bat call library built from reference bat calls from Malta. The automatic classifier achieved an overall correct classification rate of 98\%. This high correct classification rate for reliable species identification may have benefitted from the absence of typically problematic species, such as species in the genus Myotis, in the analyses.

Commercial systems are very costly. This paper proposes and demonstrates an ultrasonic recording system design that is arbitrarily scalable. The system is modular and based on retail components and open source software/hardware. Each module has four microphones and modules can be combined to extend the coverage area, obtain higher spatial recording resolution, and/or add recording redundancy. The system is designed to have no inherent scalability limits. The system has been deployed in four different test settings. The first setup tests the system's ability to make medium-term recordings (1 to 2min) with many microphones. The second setup tests the robustness of the system, being deployed throughout the Danish winter with only minor issues. The third setup integrates the system in a mobile robot as an echolocating guidance system, while the fourth setup demonstrates full-spectrum transducer calibration. In most respects this system's hardware specification surpasses all competitors on the market at a quarter of the price. Tests demonstrate that large deployments are feasible and accurate ultrasonic measurements can be obtained.

We combined morphological, bioacoustic and molecular techniques and show that it is indeed a distinct evolutionary lineage which we describe as Blommersia variabilis sp. nov. from the type locality Ambodivoahangy near Maroantsetra. This new species is morphologically most similar to B. wittei by the presence of vomerine teeth and relatively small, well-delimited femoral glands, but differs from that species by advertisement call consisting of only 2-6 notes of comparatively longer duration, and a wider separation of femoral glands in males. It is associated with dense secondary vegetation fringing lentic water bodies. Anecdotal evidence suggests its life history is similar to other congeners. The restricted range of this species implies that it is microendemic, being possibly confined to the Antainambalana watershed. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA variation show that its closest known relatives are Blommersia galani and B. dejongi, both of which also have restricted ranges on the east coast.

During the summer of 1999, we recorded the calling songs of 6 males in the vicinity of Menton (Alpes-Maritime, 06). Using temporal measures as defined by GOGALA et al. (1996), we describe these calls by means of a detailed audiospectrographical analysis. We analyse the two types of phrases together with an additional sound produced by singing males when they lift their calling position. A statistical analysis shows that some acoustic parameters are not variable between individuals. Thus we propose three temporal measures (number of short echemes (N1), duration of phrase I (T2) and duration of the silence between the last short echeme and the long echeme (T7)) and spectral properties as specific features for coding the sexual information. Then, because of possible intra-population variations, we suggest that description of cicada sound production should be provided considering, when available, several calling males from distinct populations. Furthermore we think the ratio of intra-population / inter-population variation should be estimated before calculating inter-population comparative tests.

However, although context-dependent colonization has been observed in aquatic environments, it has rarely been studied in terrestrial environments or at large spatial scales. In this paper, we assessed how landscape context influenced colonization rates in a large-scale (ca 7000 km(2)) terrestrial system where colonizers (Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus) are capable of rapid, long-distance movements. Bioacoustic recorders were used to detect first song dates (an indicator of colonization or re-colonization) and settlement in 23 naturally replicated habitat patches. We compared support for three competing hypotheses describing colonization patterns that depend on landscape context ('redirection', `landscape-selection' and `relative patch size') with two patch-level hypotheses (patch `quality' and `heterospecific attraction'). First song was earlier when habitat availability in the landscape was low, supporting the `redirection' hypothesis. Settlement probability was best predicted by patch `quality' and was lower in woodlands with a dense understorey. Results suggest that colonization of habitat patches by male P. trochilus after spring migration is spatially hierarchical. First, initial colonization depends on landscape context, and settlement is then determined by fine-scale vegetation characteristics. More broadly, we suggest that patterns observed in fragmented aquatic environments (e.g. `redirection') can, in some circumstances, be extended to large-scale terrestrial environments.",forest;fragmentation;landscape;Phylloscopus trochilus,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,2018,AUG 29,Article,English,Biology;Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

Descriptions of these repertoires represent a key first step towards understanding the vocal behaviour of any species and provide a critical foundation for comparative bioacoustic studies. In this study of the olive frog, Babina (formerly Rana) adenopleura, a territorial species from subtropical Taiwan, we used focal observations, acoustic recordings and statistical analyses of temporal, spectral and amplitude-related call properties to describe six different call types in the species' vocal repertoire. These call types included a putative advertisement call, territorial call, encounter call, amplectant call, distress call and alarm call. Advertisement calls consisted of four to five discrete notes, and they were the most commonly produced call. Territorial and encounter calls were delivered during interactions with other males; the former is a two-note call, whereas the latter is a distinctly pulsatile signal. Amplectant calls were acoustically similar to territorial calls but were delivered while males were in amplexus. Distress calls were given while the animal was being consumed by a snake, and alarm calls were recorded in response to startling stimuli.

Linetransect surveys of cetaceans were conducted across the shelf and slope, out to 150 km offshore from Newport, Oregon (44.6 degrees N) to Crescent City, California (41.9 degrees N), in conjunction with multidisciplinary mesoscale and fine-scale surveys of ocean and ecosystem structure. Occurrence patterns (presence/absence) of cetaceans were compared with hydrographic and ecological variables (e.g., sea surface salinity, sea surface temperature, thermocline depth, halocline depth, chlorophyll maximum, distance to the center of the equatorward jet, distance to the shoreward edge of the upwelling front, and acoustic backscatter at 38, 120, 200 and 420 kHz) derived from a towed, undulating array and a bioacoustic system. Using a multiple logistic regression model, 60.2\% and 94.4\% of the variation in occurrence patterns of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae during late spring and summer, respectively, were explained. Sea surface temperature, depth, and distance to the alongshore upwelling front were the most important environmental variables during June, when humpbacks occurred over the slope (200-2000 m). During August, when humpbacks concentrated over a submarine bank (Heceta Bank) and off Cape Blanco, sea surface salinity was the most important variable, followed by latitude and depth. Humpbacks did not occur in the lowest salinity water of the Columbia River plume. For harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena, the model explained 79.2\% and 70.1\% of the variation in their occurrence patterns during June and August, respectively. During spring, latitude, sea surface salinity, and thermocline gradient were the most important predictors. During summer, latitude and distance to the inshore edge of the upwelling front were the most important variables. Typically a coastal species, harbor porpoises extended their distribution farther offshore at Heceta Bank and at Cape Blanco, where they were associated with the higher chlorophyll concentrations in these regions. Pacific white-sided dolphin Lagenorhynchus obliquidens was the most numerous small cetacean in early June, but was rare during August. The model explained 44.5\% of the variation in their occurrence pattern, which was best described by distance to the upwelling front and acoustic backscatter at 38 kHz. The model of the occurrence pattern of Dall's porpoise Phocoenoides dalli was more successful when mesoscale variability in the CCS was higher during summer. Thus, the responses of cetaceans to biophysical features and upwelling processes in the northern CCS were both seasonally and spatially specific. Heceta Bank and associated flow-topography interactions were very important to a cascade of trophic dynamics that ultimately influenced the distribution of foraging cetaceans. The higher productivity associated with upwelling near Cape Blanco also had a strong influence on the distribution of cetaceans.

Historically, the Neotropical frog genus Adenomera has been considered as a difficult taxonomic group because it comprises many morphologically similar species exhibiting high levels of intraspecific polymorphism. A recent work using molecular data shed light on the phylogenetic relationships within the genus and identified several lineages that may correspond to undescribed species but did not delimit species boundaries.

We provide a redescription of A. marmorata and restrict its type locality to the Tijuca Massif, in the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Discriminant analysis classified 89\% of individual Rufous-headed Hornbills and 90\% of individual Visayan Hornbills correctly. The acoustic variables describing the most variation among individual Visayan Hornbills were spectral variables (second amplitude peak) and temporal variables (location of the maximum amplitude and call duration). The calls of individual Rufous-headed Hornbill were differentiated mainly by spectral variables (the fundamental and the first harmonic frequency, and additionally the upper quartile of the frequency range). Frequency parameters in Rufous-headed Hornbill calls were significantly lower than those in Visayan Hornbills.

Recently, the possibility of native status for a Norfolk pool frog population was raised. We used random amplified DNA (RAPD) analyses to clarify the status issue. Nine arbitrarily designed primers detected 160 polymorphisms in 174 pool frogs from 11 European locations. Polymorphism levels varied widely, being lowest in the northern populations and highest in the south. As with many isolated populations, the peninsular and insular populations of Sweden, Norway and Britain showed relatively little polymorphism. Principal component and cluster analysis showed clear geographical groupings. The Norfolk, Norwegian and Swedish individuals formed a closely related group - a northern clade, substantiating native status for the Norfolk population, which, interestingly, had idiosyncratic features suggestive of a distinctive evolutionary history. Phylograms constructed from RAPD data were consistent with an unexpected postglacial colonization route, in which the northern clade derived from migration out of Italy, via Hungary and Poland, though cryptic glacial refagia in Eastern Europe are an alternative explanation. Our RAPD analyses concur with a parallel microsatellite investigation. Both genetic studies and bioacoustic and archaeozoological findings support native status for Norfolk pool frogs and have prompted a programme for re-establishing the northern clade in England.

This study tested and validated whether DeepSqueak, a user-friendly software, developed for rodent ultrasonic vocalizations, can be generalized to automate the detection/segmentation, clustering and classification of high-frequency/ultrasonic vocalizations of a primate species. Our validation procedure showed that the trained detectors for vocalizations of the gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus) can deal with different call types, individual variation and different recording quality. Implementing additional filters drastically reduced noise signals (4225 events) and call fragments (637 events), resulting in 91\% correct detections (N-total = 3040). Additionally, the detectors could be used to detect the vocalizations of an evolutionary closely related species, the Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara). An integrated supervised classifier classified 93\% of the 2683 calls correctly to the respective call type, and the unsupervised clustering model grouped the calls into clusters matching the published human-made categories.

If the examination is performed by an experienced physician, he will intuitively adjust the amount of the force in order to achieve the optimal sound quality. However, in case of becoming increasingly popular auto-diagnosis and telemedicine auscultation devices with no such feedback mechanisms, the question arises regarding the influence of the possible force mismatch on the parameters of the recorded signal. Design The present study describes the results of the experimental investigations on the relation between pressure applied to the chestpiece of a stethoscope and parameters of the transmitted bioacoustic signals. The experiments were carried out using various stethoscopes connected to a force measurement system, which allowed to maintain fixed pressure during auscultation examinations. The signals were recorded during examinations of different volunteers, at various auscultation sites. Results The obtained results reveal strong individual and auscultation-site variability. Conclusions It is concluded that the underlying tissue deformation is the primary factor that alters the parameters of the recorded signals.",stethoscope;auscultation;tunable diaphragm;chestpiece,POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL,2017,SEP,Article,English,"Medicine, General \& Internal"

Nevertheless, knowledge of amphibian diversity needed for effective habitat protection is still highly inadequate in remote tropical regions, the greater part of the Amazonia. In this study we integrated molecular, morphological and bioacoustic evidence to evaluate the species richness of the treefrogs genus Scinax over a 1000 km transect across rainforest of the Purus-Madeira interfluve, and along the east bank of the upper Madeira river, Brazilian Amazonia. Analysis revealed that 82\% of the regional species richness of Scinax is still undescribed; two nominal species, seven confirmed candidate species, two unconfirmed candidate species, and one deep conspecific lineage were detected in the study area. DNA barcoding based analysis of the 16s rRNA gene indicates possible existence of three discrete species groups within the genus Scinax, in addition to the already-known S. rostratus species Group. Quantifying and characterizing the number of undescribed Scinax taxa on a regional scale, we provide a framework for future taxonomic study in Amazonia. These findings indicate that the level to which Amazonian anura species richness has been underestimated is far greater than expected. Consequently, special attention should be paid both to taxonomic studies and protection of the still-neglected Amazonian Scinax treefrogs.",,PLOS ONE,2016,NOV 2,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

The forehead was segmented along the body axis and sectioned into cross section slices, which were further cut into sample pieces for measurements. Hounsfield units (HUs) of the corresponding measured pieces were obtained from CT scans, and regression analyses were conducted to investigate the linear relationships between the tissues' HUs and velocity, and HUs and density. The distributions of the acoustic properties of the head at axial, coronal, and sagittal cross sections were reconstructed, revealing that the nasal passage system was asymmetric and the cornucopia-shaped spermaceti organ was in the right nasal passage, surrounded by tissues and airsacs. A distinct dense theca was discovered in the posterior-dorsal area of the melon, which was characterized by low velocity in the inner core and high velocity in the outer region. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences in density, velocity, and acoustic impedance between all four structures, melon, spermaceti organ, muscle, and connective tissue (p < 0.001).

Sperm whales constantly produce relatively low-frequency biosonar signals whenever foraging; therefore, over the past decade, passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has become a basic tool, used for both measuring depredation activity and accelerating field tests of potential depredation countermeasures. This paper reviews and summarizes past published PAM research on SEASWAP, and then provides a detailed example of how PAM methods are currently being used to test countermeasures. The review covers two major research thrusts: (i) identifying acoustic outputs of fishing vessels that provide long-distance ``cues{''} that attract whales to fishing activity; and (ii) validating whether distinctive ``creak{''} sounds can be used to quantify and measure depredation rates, using both bioacoustic tags and statistical comparisons between visual and acoustic depredation estimates during federal sablefish surveys. The latter part of the paper then provides an example of how PAM is being used to study a particular potential countermeasure: an ``acoustic decoy{''} which transmits fishing vessel acoustic cues to attract animals away from true fishing activity. The results of an initial 2011 field trial are presented to show how PAM was used to design the decoy signals and monitor the efficacy of the deployment. The ability of PAM to detect both whale presence and depredation behaviour has reduced the need to deploy researchers or other specialists on fishing cruises. Instead, volunteer fishers can deploy ``user-friendly{''} acoustic recorders on their gear, greatly facilitating the testing of various deterrents, and providing the industry and regulators a convenient and unobtrusive tool for monitoring both the scale and long-term spread of this behaviour across the Alaskan fishery.",acoustic deterrent;commercial fishing;depredation;Gulf of Alaska;longline;marine mammals;passive acoustic monitoring;sablefish;sperm whales,ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,2015,MAY-JUN,Review,English,Fisheries;Marine \& Freshwater Biology;Oceanography

Partial sequences of mitochondrial (12S and 16S ribosomal RNA) and nuclear (rhodopsin) genes (1275 bp total) were analyzed from 43 samples of Hypopachus, three currently recognized species of Gastrophryne, and seven arthroleptid, brevicipitid and microhylid outgroup taxa. Maximum parsimony (PAUP), maximum likelihood (RAxML) and Bayesian inference (MrBayes) optimality criteria were used for phylogenetic analyses, and BEAST was used to estimate divergence dates of major clades. Population-level analyses were conducted with the programs NETWORK and Arlequin. Results confirm the placement of Hypopachus and Gastrophryne as sister taxa, but the latter genus was strongly supported as paraphyletic. The African phrynomerine genus Phrynomantis was recovered as the sister taxon to a monophyletic Chiasmocleis, rendering our well-supported clade of gastrophrynines paraphyletic. Hypopachus barberi was supported as a disjunctly distributed highland species, and we recovered a basal split in lowland populations of Hypopachus variolosus from the Pacific versant of Mexico and elsewhere in the Mesoamerican lowlands. Dating analyses from BEAST estimate speciation within the genus Hypopachus occurred in the late Miocene/early Pliocene for most clades. Previous studies have not found bioacoustic or morphological differences among these lowland clades, and our molecular data support the continued recognition of two species in the genus Hypopachus.

Overlap in ranges during migration and morphological similarity have led to difficulties in distinguishing the Brown Boobook from the Northern Boobook. Methods: PCR of cytochrome-b and Sanger sequencing of Ninox samples from Singapore and Brunei were used to determine sample identity. Results: Two out of four Singaporean samples and the Brunei sample were identified as Northern Boobooks. This is the first official record of this species in Singapore and represents a considerable range extension for the species. Further, the samples belong to the mitochondrially distinct lineage previously characterized in resident Taiwanese populations rather than to the well-known nominate migratory lineage. Conclusions: Our data show that the mitochondrial signature previously documented in resident Taiwanese populations of the Northern Boobook extends to migratory populations. This cryptic lineage may be more widespread in its breeding quarters, extending to the Chinese and Russian mainland, in which case the name florensis would apply to it.

The description is based on an analysis of 1523 distress vocalizations, totalling 8.54 min of record. The Poicephalus distress calls sound like a threatening growl that is composed of a series of short harmonic, scarcely modulated pulses, one following another in a short time. To be efficient over long distances and to be easily located by all possible receivers, the basic acoustic shape of this call showed a complex carrier frequency, numerous harmonics, low frequency modulation and wide frequency range. The highest frequencies of distress call emitted by African Poicephalus parrots exceeded 10 kHz; high frequencies are greatly attenuated with distance so that the distress call may efficiently provide information on both long distances and also on short ones. The degradation of high frequencies may be used by the receiver to determine the emitter distance or to startle mam mal predators into releasing the distressed parrot. The distress call of African Poicephalus parrots is also a sexually dimorphic vocalization, with significant differences in the main physical parameters of the two sexes of all the species studied. Finally we found significantly differences between species and super-species even though the vocalization is extremely conservative.",distress call;vocal dimorphism;high frequency utterances;African parrots,ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION,2001,MAR,Article,English,Behavioral Sciences;Zoology

However, calls and associated behaviors remain poorly described for many anuran species. Here we describe the advertisement and release calls of the tree frog Phyllomedusa ayeaye (Lutz, 1966) and report on the social context of emissions and a physical combat. Approximately 35 minutes of digital recordings were obtained from 34 hours of observations at one breeding site in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Bioacoustic analysis showed that males emitted two types of advertisement calls: 1) simple call (a sequence of short pulsed notes) and 2) composite call (a sequence of short pulsed notes followed by a long pulsed note). Composite calls were emitted more frequently during more intense chorus activity, with various active males at the breeding site. The release call was also composed by short pulsed notes, with a wider spectrum of frequencies and emitted more rapidly than the advertisement calls. Our results suggest that the composite call of P. ayeaye may represent a mixed advertisement call. Long notes might be the aggressive part directed to males, whereas short notes directed to females. Our description of call types, their functions, and male physical interactions will be useful for studies investigating the systematics and behavior of Phyllomedusa species.",Aggressive behavior;bioacoustics;Cerrado;composite call;Phyllomedusinae,ZOOLOGIA,2015,AUG,Article,English,Zoology

Central Andean Bolivian populations previously assigned to either P. peruvianus or P. dundeei, and lowland Amazonian populations from southern Peru and northern Bolivia previously considered P. peruvianus do not correspond to these species. Indeed, multivariate analyses of qualitative and quantitative morphological and bioacoustic characters, and phylogenetic analyses support the hypothesis that they represent different, previously unknown, cryptic lineages. They are herein described as new species. The former is a sibling species of P. fenestratus that inhabits the Amazonian and semideciduous forests of the Andean foothills in central Bolivia. The latter is sibling to the Andean species P. danae and is parapatric to it in the Amazonian lowland forests and adjacent foothills of northern Bolivia, southern Peru and adjacent Brazil. Most species of Neotropical frogs, and especially Pristimantis, have been described by using external qualitative morphological characters only. An extended integrative taxonomic approach, as exemplified herein, may lead to the discovery of many other cryptic and sibling lineages that would increase the species numbers of tropical areas.

It occurs sympatrically with two other species of the complex (B. ankaratra and B. schuboeae). Morphological differentiation of species within the B. ankaratra clade remains elusive, but species are well characterized by distinct advertisement calls, with B. boppa having the longest note duration and inter-note intervals when compared to closely related species. Furthermore, it has moderate differentiation in mitochondrial DNA, with pairwise distances of 1.9-3.7\% to all other species in sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA marker. Additional evidence is given by the lack of haplotype sharing with related species for the nuclear exon DNAH-3. All examples of syntopic occurrence in this complex involve species with strongly different advertisement calls, while allopatric species have more similar calls.

We demonstrate pronounced differences in body part measurements and sex-specific coloration amongst all three taxa. Our bioacoustic comparisons also indicate differences in frequency and timing of the two main types of vocalisation among taxa, although further sampling needs to corroborate these findings. We further show that plumage differences and probably also vocal differences-among Banded Pitta taxa are more pronounced than between sister species in three other Pitta complexes. We argue that the three Banded Pitta taxa should be classified as parapatric rather than allopatric, based on their frequent and ongoing contact during glacials when sea-levels drop to create land connections across their Sundaic range. Based on comparisons with other parapatric Pitta species, biological species status is recommended for the three Banded Pitta taxa.

We recorded spontaneous fee-bee songs produced by wild-caught male and female adult black-capped chickadees housed in captivity and used bioacoustic analyses to examine seven acoustic features in the songs. Using potential for individual coding and discriminant function analyses, we found that songs were individually distinctive. Using additional discriminant function analyses, we found that songs could be correctly classified based on sex of the producer. Specifically, our results indicate that the frequency decrease within the fee note (i.e., fee glissando) varies between the songs produced by males and females and this suggests that the fee glissando may be used as a sex identifier. While this study provides a quantitative description of the acoustic structure of female song, the development, perception and function of female song in this species requires further examination.

The `descended larynx' of adult humans has traditionally been considered unique to our species, representing all adaptation for articulate speech, and debate concerning the position of the larynx in extinct hominids assumes that a lowered larynx is diagnostic of speech and language. Here, we use bioacoustic analyses of vocalizing animals, together with anatomical analyses of functional morphology, to document descended larynges in red and fallow deer. The resting position of the larynx in males of these species is similar to that in humans, and, during roaring, red-deer stags lower the larynx even further, to the sternum. These findings indicate that laryngeal descent is not uniquely human and has evolved at least twice in independent lineages. We suggest that laryngeal descent serves to elongate the vocal tract, allowing callers to exaggerate their perceived body size by decreasing vocal-tract resonant frequencies. Vocal-tract elongation is common in birds and is probably present ill additional mammals.

Vocalisations have long played an important role in diagnosing potentially reproductively isolated groups of birds. The chattering-type call of A. gentilis plays a role in advertisement and pair-contact, making this a suitable basis for taxonomic study of vocalisations.

The proposed solution is based on a subspace detector of sigmoidal-frequency signals with unknown time-varying amplitude. This detection strategy takes into account frequency variations of blue whale calls as well as the presence of other transient sounds that can interfere with Z-calls (such as airguns or other whale calls). The proposed method has been tested on more than 105 h of acoustic data containing about 2200 Z-calls (as found by an experienced human operator). This method is shown to have a correct-detection rate of up to more than 15\% better than the extensible bioacoustic tool package, a spectrogram-based correlation detector commonly used to study blue whales. Because the proposed method relies on subspace detection, it does not suffer from some drawbacks of correlation-based detectors. In particular, it does not require the choice of an a priori fixed and subjective template. The analytic expression of the detection performance is also derived, which provides crucial information for higher level analyses such as animal density estimation from acoustic data. Finally, the detection threshold automatically adapts to the soundscape in order not to violate a user-specified false alarm rate.

These marine mammals produce several distinct types of vocalizations for intraspecific communication during the breeding season. In this study, we provide the first evidence of walrus-generated sounds during foraging dives when they feed on bivalves. We recorded two types of sounds that we associated to different feeding mechanisms. The first sound type was brief and low in frequency that we relate to the suction of soft parts from the bivalves' shells through the use of walrus powerful tongues, which is the common feeding behavior reported in the walrus literature. We also recorded a second sound type composed of multiple broadband pulse trains. We hypothesize the latter were associated with bivalve shell cracking by walruses, which would represent a new feeding mechanism in the walrus literature. This new feeding mechanism is either related to bivalves' ecology or to walruses removing the sediment when searching for food. During this study, we observed bivalves lying on the seafloor instead of being buried in the sediment in walrus feeding areas while scuba diving. As a result, walruses cannot use suction to feed on soft body part of bivalves and have to use another strategy, mastication. Our findings provide a first step towards using passive acoustics to quantify walrus behavior and feeding ecology.",Bioacoustics;Bivalves;Feeding behavior;Marine mammal;Young Sound fjord,POLAR BIOLOGY,2022,JUN,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology

However, some recent bioacoustic researches have operated a change of scale by developing acoustic indices which aim is to characterize animal acoustic communities and soundscapes. We here review these indices for the first time. The indices can be divided into two classes: the a or within-group indices and the beta or between-group indices. Up to 21 a acoustic indices were proposed in less than six years. These indices estimate the amplitude, evenness, richness, heterogeneity of an acoustic community or soundscape. Seven beta diversity indices were suggested to compare amplitude envelopes or, more often, frequency spectral profiles. Both a and beta indices reported congruent and expected results but they may still suffer some bias due, for instance, to anthropic background noise or variations in the distances between vocalising animals and the sensors. Research is still needed to improve the reliability of these new mathematical tools for biodiversity assessment and monitoring. We recommend the contemporary use of some of these indices to obtain complementary information. Eventually, we foresee that this new field of research which tries to build bridges between animal behaviour and ecology should meet an important success in the next years for the assessment and monitoring of marine, freshwater and terrestrial biodiversity from individual-based level to landscape dimension.",,ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA,2014,JUL-AUG,Article,English,Acoustics

In the present study we test whether two different schedules of food reinforcement, fixed ratio continuous reinforcement and variable ratio partial reinforcement, cause adult black-capped chickadees to change the structure of their chick-a-dee calls. We also examine how these calls differ in two contexts: being alone versus when experiencing an alarming event. Wild-caught black-capped chickadees were housed in isolation to prevent social interaction and recorded weekly for seven weeks. Baseline recordings on week one show that calls given alone differed from those given during an alarming event in both note type composition and frequency (i.e. pitch). Calls also changed over time between birds on the two different schedules of reinforcement. In addition, birds on different reinforcement schedules responded differently during the two recording conditions. Our results suggest that call characteristics can be modified rapidly and may reflect abiotic environmental conditions. If call structure varies consistently with particular abiotic environmental conditions, much can be gained from bioacoustic analyses of calls from wild birds. However, vocal patterns must be consistent across dialects, and we must disentangle vocal changes due to the abiotic environment from those due to social interaction. Further research is needed from natural populations and across multiple regions.",songbird;black-capped chickadee;communication;operant conditioning,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,2009,SEP 15,Article,English,Biology

Absorptivity measurements: were made with a broadband source (between frequencies of 0.6 and 5.0 kHz) as a function of time between a fixed sourer and a fixed receiver separated by 12km in relatively shallow (83m) water. The sardine (Sardina pilchardus Walbaum) was the dominant species at this measurement site. The second most common species was the anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus Linnaeus): there were approximately twice as many sardines as anchovies. The number densities of all other species were small, Strong absorption lines were evident at the resonance frequencies of dispersed sardines. The frequencies of these absorption lines changed in accordance with the vertical migration of sardines at twilight. A correction for the influence of anchovies on the absorption lint, which was dominated by dispersed sardines at night was applied to the absorption-based estimate. Initial echo sounder based estimates of number densities, which were based on a ``universal{''} pressure independent equation of target strength were corrected for pressure dependence. Attenuation by near surface bubbles, and avoidance. The corrected absorption based number density of sardines (1.4 m (-2)) was in excellent agreement with the average corrected echo sounder based estimate (1.0 m(-2)).

Studies of hybrid zones are increasingly revealing the essential role of ecological and behavioral features both in initiating crossbreeding and in maintaining interspecific barriers. We studied the hybridization of two species of marmots Marmota baibacina and M. sibirica in the zone of sympatry in Mongolian Altai Mountains. We used a bioacoustic approach to determine the localization of individuals of different species and their cohabitation sites. Genetic typing with two diploid nuclear markers and one marker each of paternal and maternal lines was used to identify hybrids. Habitat preferences of marmots were studied to understand the conditions for the formation of heterospecific pairs. We found a high proportion of hybrid individuals in boulder screes where conditions for the formation of heterospecific pairs probably exist.

These calls are commonly used for both within- and between-group communication in many bird and primate species. In the Neotropics, mated pairs of socially monogamous titi monkeys (genus Callicebus) emit conspicuous, coordinated loud calls. These vocalizations appear to play a role in territorial defense, a hypothesis derived from studies of only three of the 31 recognized Callicebus species. Here, we describe the acoustic properties and organization of the loud calls of black-fronted titi monkeys (Callicebus nigrifrons). We compare the behavioral and ecological contexts associated with these vocalizations to investigate their role in within- and between-group communication, resource defense, and mate defense. Black-fronted titi monkeys create loud calls by combining a finite number of syllables to form more complex phrases, which are assembled to compose long sequences of loud calls. Bioacoustic features distinguish the loud calls used in different contexts, involving communication within- and between-groups. We found support for the hypothesis that vocalizations used for between-group communication are cooperative displays used by the mated pair and other group members to regulate access to important food resources, such as fruits. On the other hand, we only found weak support for the mate defense hypothesis.

There is substantial evidence that environmental factors such as weather conditions or habitat structure can affect echolocation call structure in bats and thus compromise proper species identification. However, intraspecific differences in echolocation due to geographical variation are poorly understood, which poses a number of issues in terms of method standardization. We examined acoustic data for Pteronotus cf rubiginosus from the Central Amazon and the Guiana Shield. We provide the first evidence of intraspecific geographic variation in bat echolocation in the Neotropics, with calls significantly differing in almost all standard acoustic parameters for the two lineages of this Glade. We complement our bioacoustic data with molecular and morphological data for both species. Considerable overlap in trait values prevents reliable discrimination between the two sympatric Pteronotus based on morphological characters. On the other hand, significant divergence in the frequency of maximum energy suggests that bioacoustics can be used to readily separate both taxa despite extensive intraspecific variability in their echolocation across the Amazon.

Extant species are morphologically similar and have a circum-Mediterranean distribution. We assembled a multilocus dataset from seven nuclear and four mitochondrial genes for several individuals of all but one of the extant species and reconstructed a robust phylogeny by applying a coalescent-based species-tree method and a concatenation approach, both of which gave congruent results. The earliest phylogenetic split within Discoglossus separates D. montalentii from a clade comprising all other species. Discoglossus montalentii is monophyletic for haplotype variation at all loci and has distinct morphological, bioacoustic and karyotypic characters. We find moderate support for a sister-group relationship between the Iberian taxa and the Moroccan D. scovazzi, and high support for a D. pictus - D. sardus clade distributed around the Tyrrhenian basin. Topological discordance among gene trees during the speciation of D. galganoi, D. scovazzi, D. pictus and D. sardus is interpreted as the consequence of nearly simultaneous, vicariant diversification. The timing of these events is unclear, but possibly coincided with the final geotectonic rearrangement of the Western Mediterranean in the Middle Miocene or later during the Messinian salinity crisis. The Iberian taxa D. galganoi galganoi and D. g. jeanneae are reciprocally monophyletic in mitochondrial DNA but not in nuclear gene trees, and are therefore treated as subspecies of D. galganoi.

To understand which variables influenced geographic variation in the advertisement call of Dendropsophus nanus, a generalist species with a broad distribution in South America, we tested three nonexclusive hypotheses: geographic distance, environ men till temperature, and body size. The advertisement call of this species consists of two note types: Type A, which functions in spacing among males in aggregations, and Type B, which may influence female choice. To determine the effect of the three explanatory variables on each note, we sampled nine populations in central and southern Brazil, We found that geographic distance and temperature were the main variables explaining variation in both notes. An exploratory analysis revealed, differences in the advertisement call between populations in western and eastern localities. Because temperature was spatially structured, geographic distance may have produced variation in temperature along the longitudinal gradient, resulting in the observed variation in bioacoustic parameters among populations. Also, we observed that individuals in warmer localities were smaller than those from colder localities, and this difference in body size was correlated to the note repetition rate of Type A notes. Our liridings indicate that variation in acoustic parameters may be an indirect result of temperature acting on body size.

To assess peripheral auditory phase sensitivity, changes in the response properties of VIIIth nerve fibers were measured when the relative phase angle of a single harmonic component nearest a unit's best excitatory frequency was systematically varied. The results revealed that shifts in the phase spectrum are encoded in at least 3 different ways by the peripheral auditory system of the bullfrog: 1) by changes in the degree of spike synchronization of fibers from both inner ear organs (the amphibian papilla and the basilar papilla) to the fundamental waveform period; 2) by changes in the shapes of period histograms of fibers from both organs; and 3) by changes in the spike rates of amphibian papilla fibers. The presence of phase sensitivity in the peripheral auditory system of the bullfrog indicates that information regarding the fine-temporal waveshape and the underlying phase spectrum of an acoustic signal is contained within the spike trains of VIIIth nerve fibers. Similar sensitivities to changes in the phase spectra and temporal waveshapes of acoustic signals may also be present in the peripheral auditory system of other vertebrates.

Among acoustic insects, cicada males are particularly known for their loud and diverse sounds which function importantly in communication. The main method of sound production in cicadas is the tymbal mechanism, and a relative small number of cicada species possess both tymbal and stridulatory organs. However, cicadas of the genus Karenia do not have any specialized sound-producing structures, so they are referred to as ``mute{''}. This denomination is quite misleading, as they indeed produce sounds. Here, we investigate the sound-producing mechanism and acoustic communication of the ``mute{''} cicada, Karenia caelatata, and discover a new sound-production mechanism for cicadas: i.e., K. caelatata produces impact sounds by banging the forewing costa against the operculum. The temporal, frequency and amplitude characteristics of the impact sounds are described. Morphological studies and reflectance-based analyses reveal that the structures involved in sound production of K. caelatata (i.e., forewing, operculum, cruciform elevation, and wing-holding groove on scutellum) are all morphologically modified. Acoustic playback experiments and behavioral observations suggest that the impact sounds of K. caelatata are used in intraspecific communication and function as calling songs. The new sound-production mechanism expands our knowledge on the diversity of acoustic signaling behavior in cicadas and further underscores the need for more bioacoustic studies on cicadas which lack tymbal mechanism.",,PLOS ONE,2015,FEB 25,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

First, we provide an overview of those alpine QTP endemics that represent late Miocene and Pliocene lineage splits, i.e. early colonisations to the central alpine QTP region. As an example, true rosefinches (genus Carpodacus) presumably evolved from a forested eastern QTP centre of origin and colonised the (semi-) open plateau habitats several times independently. Second, we discuss younger speciation events corresponding to phylogeographic east-west divides along the southern QTP margin.

The fluctuation function F-q(s), generalized Hurst exponent h(q), multifractal scaling exponent tau(q), and the multifractal spectrum f(alpha) calculated in the procedure followed were analyzed to comprehend the underlying nonlinearities in the seahorse clicks. The analyses carried out reveal long-range power-law correlation properties in the data, substantiating the multifractal behavior. The resulting h(q) spectrum exhibits a distinct characteristic pattern in relation to the seahorse sex and size, and reveals a spectral blind spot in the data that was not possible to detect by conventional spectral analyses. The corresponding multifractal spectrum related width parameter Delta h(q) is well clustered, defining the individual seahorse clicks. The highest degree of multifractality is evident in the 18 cm male seahorse, signifying greater heterogeneity. A further comparison between the seahorse body size and weight (wet) with respect to the width parameter Delta h(q) and the second-order Hurst exponent h(q = 2) underscores the versatility of MFDFA as a robust statistical tool to analyze bioacoustic observations.

The origin of the radiation on the Canarian Archipelago was apparently one of the central islands-Tenerife or Gran Canaria. The populations on El Hierro (P. t. ombriosus) and La Palma (P. t. palmensis) represent distinct monophyletic lineages. Blue tits from Gran Canaria are genetically distinct from those of La Gomera and Tenerife (P. t. teneriffae), which supports the results of other studies and suggests the existence of an-until now-undescribed taxon there. In contrast, the populations on the eastern islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote (P. t. degener) could not be distinguished from North African blue tits (P. t. ultramarinus), and these populations should be subsumed under the subspecies ultramarinus. Taxonomic recommendations based on these results include the distinction of the northern European P. caeruleus from P. teneriffae, including blue tits from North Africa and the Canary Islands, the treatment of degener and ultramarinus as synonymous (P. teneriffae ultramarinus) and a new blue tit taxon on the island of Gran Canaria (P. t. hedwigii nov. ssp.), which is formally described.

Among anurans, however, acoustic communication also plays an important role in intrasex conflicts. Although there is evidence for the influence of spectral parameters of calls (e.g., fundamental and dominant frequencies) in anuran disputes, the role that temporal parameters (e.g., duration and repetition rate) play in success during physical conflicts is still poorly understood. We describe the behavior of male frogs in agonistic interactions and investigate the functions of the different types of calls emitted in different social contexts. We also evaluate how body characteristics (mass and body size) and bioacoustic characteristics (repetition rate of the calls) influence success in physical conflicts ofPithecopus nordestinus(Anura: Phyllomedusidae). Agonistic disputes involved gradation in the emission of calls, visual displays, and physical clashes. The fighting call increased in proportion during clashes, indicating a function associated with aggression/intimidation. The uneasiness call (new subcategory herein defined) was only performed by losers during physical clashes, suggesting a meaning of submission or restlessness. No differences were found in any of the morphological parameters between winners and losers of physical disputes. On the other hand, the repetition rate of the aggressive call was positively related to success in fights and proved to be a good predictor of success in fights between males ofP. nordestinus. Our results contribute to understanding the influence of temporal parameters of calls on success in physical disputes of this Neotropical treefrog.",Anura;Caatinga;Aggressive call;Agonistic dispute;Physical clashes;Acoustic interactions,ACTA ETHOLOGICA,2020,JUN,Article,English,Behavioral Sciences;Zoology

These lineages show a geographic pattern corresponding to known subspecies or subspecies groups. Genetic variation within the widely-distributed group West is low and neutrality tests supported a recent expansion scenario. The haplotypes from Kamchatka, representing a separated sublineage with clear affinity to the European-Siberian group, are almost identical, implying a recent bottleneck. Group East contained two subclades without clear geographic pattern, presumably due to admixing of populations that had diverged in Pleistocene refuges. The homogeneity of the Kyushu population supports historical reports of introduction of the species from Korea. In contrast, the high variation in the recently established Hokkaido population may reflect an ongoing invasion from several populations of the Far Eastern mainland. Bioacoustic data based on chatter call differentiate groups of subspecies and reflect phylogeographic patterns, i.e., mitochondrial lineages. Furthermore, we report the fast spreading of P. p. jankowskii towards the west along the upper Amur River, and a slower shifting of P. p. leucoptera in the opposite direction thus yielding a new contact zone.

Seven species of this genus occur on Marojejy, a steep massif in northeastern Madagascar. Here we examine the elevational distribution, phylogenetic position, biogeographic origin, and genetic differentiation of this Stumpffia assemblage. We show that none of these species is another's closest relative, but rather they are all independent lineages that probably colonised the Marojejy Massif through repeated immigration events. All of the lineages on Marojejy are most closely related to species south and southwest of the massif, except one lineage, formerly known as Stumpffia sp. Cao7, but here assigned to S. sorata as a deep conspecific lineage (and referred to as S. cf. sorata), which occurs also in Sorata, 90 km north of Marojejy. The species on Marojejy are typically restricted to narrow elevational ranges, but at least two species, S. cf. sorata and S. tridactyla, occur over elevations spanning 1000 metres. We assessed the genetic variability of these populations, and found considerable haplotype separation in fragments of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA and nuclear Rag-1 genes, suggesting some disruption of gene flow associated with elevation.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely used in behavioral sciences, and today are considered a valuable classification tool for reducing the level of subjectivity and allowing replicable results across different studies. However, to date, no studies have applied this tool to nonhuman primate vocalizations. Here, we apply for the first time ANNs, to discriminate the vocal repertoire in a primate species, Eulemur macaco macaco. We designed an automatic procedure to extract both spectral and temporal features from signals, and performed a comparative analysis between a supervised Multilayer Perceptron and two statistical approaches commonly used in primatolou (Discriminant Function Analysis and Cluster Analysis), in order to explore pros and cons of these methods in bioacoustic classification. Our results show that ANNs were able to recognize all seven vocal categories previously described (92.5-95.6\%) and perform better than either statistical analysis (76.1-88.4\%). The results show that ANNs can provide an effective and robust method for automatic classification also in primates, suggesting that neural models can represent a valuable tool to contribute to a better understanding of primate vocal communication. The use of neural networks to identify primate vocalizations and the further development of this approach in studying primate communication are discussed. Am. J. Primatol. 72:337-348, 2010.

These unique frogs are generally considered to be basal neobatrachians, although their relationships to other neobatrachian taxa, except the Nasikabatrachidae, remain unresolved. Our molecular phylogeny based on a dataset consisting of fragments of the nuclear rag-1 and rag-2 genes, as well as mitochondrial 16S rRNA in representatives of the major neobatrachian lineages, confirmed the previously postulated Sooglossidae + Nasikabatrachidae clade and the placement of the South American Caudiverbera with the Australian Myobatrachidae, but did not further resolve the position of sooglossids. Our results do, however, unambiguously show sooglossids to be monophyletic but the genus Sooglossus to be paraphyletic, with the type species Sooglossus sechellensis being more closely related to Nesomantis thomasseti than to Sooglossus gardineri and Sooglossus pipilodryas, in agreement with morphological, karyological, and bioacoustic data. As a taxonomic consequence, we propose to consider the genus name Nesomantis as junior synonym of Sooglossus, and to transfer the species thomasseti to Sooglossus. For the clade composed of the species gardineri and pipilodryas, here, we propose the new generic name Leptosooglossus.

The tadpoles of these four species are brown to yellowish benthic forms with a depressed body shape, dorsally directed eyes and relatively low fins. The oral discs are generalised and all species exhibit a wide gap in dorsal papillae. There is variation among different developmental stages with regard to the keratodont row formulae. In Mantidactylus betsileanus, younger stages (25 and 26) exhibit the formula 1: 3+3/1+1:2,whereas it is 1:4+4/1+1:2 in older stages (36 and 38). In M. sp. aff. betsileanus ``very slow calls{''}, keratodont row formulae vary within one developmental stage (25-26) from 1: 3+3/3 to 1: 4+4/3, whereas it seems to be constantly 1: 4+4/3 in all examined developmental stages of M. sp. aff. betsileanus ``Vohidrazana{''}. In general, the larvae of the different Brygoomantis species studied are morphologically similar to each other. Differences between species mainly concern colouration, shape of body and the number of keratodonts per millimetre, which is approximately 38 in M. betsileanus, 50 in M. biporus, and 60 in the two undescribed species.",Amphibia;Mantellidae;Mantidactylus;Brygoomantis;Mantidactylus betsileanus;M. biporus;tadpole;descriptions;DNA barcoding,ZOOTAXA,2007,OCT 17,Article,English,Zoology

Here, we describe through integrative taxonomy a new species of the Allobates tapajos species complex from the upper Madeira River, southwestern Amazonia. Species delimitation analyses based on molecular data are congruent and delimit five candidate species in addition to A. tapajos sensu stricto.

The new species differs from nominal congeners in adult and larval morphology and in male advertisement call. Egg deposition sites differ between east and west banks of the upper Madeira River, but there is no evidence of corresponding morphologic or bioacoustic differentiation. The new species appears to be restricted to riparian forests; its known geographic range falls entirely within the influence zone of reservoirs of two large dams, which underscores the urgent need of a conservation assessment through long-term monitoring.

In contrast to other mammals, toothed whales generate their vocalizations (i.e., echolocation clicks) by a pneumatically-driven process in their nasal complex. This study is dedicated to a better understanding of sound generation and emission in toothed whales based on morphological documentation and bioacoustic interpretation. We present an extensive description of the nasal morphology including the nasal muscles in the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) using macroscopical dissections, computer-assisted tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and histological sections. In general, the morphological data presented here substantiate and extend the unified ``phonic lips{''} hypothesis of sound generation in toothed whales suggested by Cranford et al. (J Morphol 1996;228:223-285). There are, however, some morpbological peculiarities in the porpoise nasal complex which might help explain the typical polycyclic structure of the clicks emitted. We hypothesize that the tough connective tissue capsule (porpoise capsule) surrounding the sound generating apparatus is a structural prerequisite for the production of these high-frequency clicks. The topography of the deep rostral nasal air sacs (anterior nasofrontal and premaxillary sacs), narrowing the potential acoustic pathway from the phonic lips to the melon (a large fat body in front of the nasal passage), and the surrounding musculature should be crucial factors in the formation of focused narrowbanded sound beams in the harbor porpoise.

To monitor this change of frog population and optimise the protection policy, frog call classification has become an important bioacoustic research topic. However, automatic acoustic classification of frog calls has not been adequately addressed in the literature. In this paper, an enhanced feature representation for frog call classification using the temporal, perceptual and cepstral features is presented. With the enhanced feature representation, the time-frequency information of frog calls can be effectively represented, which gives a good classification performance. To be specific, each continuous frog recording is first segmented into individual syllables using the Harmd's method. Then, temporal, perceptual, and.cepstral features are calculated from each syllable: syllable duration, Shannon entropy, Renyi entropy, zero-crossing rate, averaged energy, oscillation rate, spectral centroid, spectral flatness, spectral roll-off, signal bandwidth, spectral flux, fundamental frequency, linear predictive coding, and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. Next, different feature vectors are fused to obtain different enhanced feature representations. Finally, different enhanced feature representations are compared using five machine learning algorithms: linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest neighbour, support vector machines, random forest, and artificial neural network. Experiment results show that our proposed feature representation could achieve better classification performance comparing to other methods with twenty-four frog species, which are geographically well distributed throughout Queensland, Australia.

We add to the current knowledge of this group by analyzing its diversity and describing a new hyperossified species from some important Atlantic Forest remnants in southeastern Brazil, including those bordering Sao Paulo, the largest and most populous city in South America. The new species is diagnosed by a combination of morphological, osteological, and bioacoustic characters, with further evidence of mtDNA sequences to confirm its distinction from the other congeners. The parotic and paravertebral bone plates externally bordered with a rough and pale contour can readily distinguish the new species from the other hyperossified species within Brachycephalus.

HRTF is an anthropometric feature-dependent function that yields the direction-dependent gain of the auditory system. Even though it is subject to the distance of the auditory source, distance-dependent HRTF measurement is rare due to its high experimental cost. Numerical simulation tools can provide viable alternatives. The required computational resources and time increase exponentially with the frequencies and degree of freedom (DoF) of the simulations; still, it is faster than experimental procedures. This work proposes finite element computational solutions to measure distance-dependent HRTFs using domain truncation methods in association with frequency-dependent adaptive meshing. Two hybrid techniques to find HRTF in the entire region, employing infinite elements (IEs) and non-reflective boundary conditions (NRBCs) with near-field to far-field transformation techniques, have been implemented and analyzed. The proposed methods calculate distance-dependent HRTF in 0.2-20 kHz frequency band, with reduced computational cost and time. Additionally, the spatial resolution of the HRTF measurement has increased a 100-fold. Since locally connected finite elements are used, the near-field effects of HRTF are well incorporated, and the obtained HRTF matches well with the experimental results. The proposed tools can also calculate sufficiently accurate HRTFs even when the surface meshes are of reduced quality. The tools also possess the versatility in effortlessly integrating appropriate bioacoustic attributes (e.g., internal reflection of the middle ear walls) into HRTF numerical models, which is noteworthy.",Head-related transfer function;Finite element method;Infinite elements;Perfectly matched layers,ACOUSTICS AUSTRALIA,2022,JUN,Article,English,Acoustics

While the latter processes are easily quantifiable, documentation of the loss of biodiversity and community structure is more difficult. Changes in organismal abundance and diversity are barely documented. Censuses of species are usually fragmentary and inferred by often spatially, temporally and ecologically unsatisfactory simple species lists for individual study sites. Thus, detrimental global processes and their drivers often remain unrevealed. A major impediment to monitoring species diversity is the lack of human taxonomic expertise that is implicitly required for large-scale and fine-grained assessments. Another is the large amount of personnel and associated costs needed to cover large scales, or the inaccessibility of remote but nonetheless affected areas. To overcome these limitations we propose a network of Automated Multisensor stations for Monitoring of species Diversity (AMMODs) to pave the way for a new generation of biodiversity assessment centers. This network combines cutting-edge technologies with biodiversity informatics and expert systems that conserve expert knowledge. Each AMMOD station combines autonomous samplers for insects, pollen and spores, audio recorders for vocalizing animals, sensors for volatile organic compounds emitted by plants (pVOCs) and camera traps for mammals and small invertebrates. AMMODs are largely self-containing and have the ability to pre-process data (e.g. for noise filtering) prior to transmission to receiver stations for storage, integration and analyses. Installation on sites that are difficult to access require a sophisticated and challenging system design with optimum balance between power requirements, bandwidth for data transmission, required service, and operation under all environmental conditions for years. An important prerequisite for automated species identification are databases of DNA barcodes, animal sounds, for pVOCs, and images used as training data for automated species identification. AMMOD stations thus become a key component to advance the field of biodiversity monitoring for research and policy by delivering biodiversity data at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.

The White-chinned Petrel is the most commonly killed species in Southern Ocean fisheries and its breeding success at many sites is reduced because of predation by invasive cats and rodents. As adaptive management of such threats requires cost-effective and reproducible protocols for monitoring populations, we examined the potential of automated bioacoustic techniques for measuring colony attendance patterns (relative number of birds visiting at a given time) using data from acoustic recorders deployed over a breeding season at Bird Island, South Georgia. Generic recognition software was of limited utility, but a suite of acoustic indices in a random forest model reliably predicted the occurrence of vocalisations. Vocal activity showed clear temporal patterns, despite high day-to-day variability, and was lowest during the pre-laying period, in the early evening, and on moonlit nights. To facilitate estimation of population density using acoustic recorders, we determined the mean vocalisation rate of individuals (2.3 min(-1)), mean call length (similar to 15.3 sec), and detection distance (similar to 15 m based on signal to noise ratios of playbacks). Our results indicate that acoustic indices are a useful measure of colony attendance. If these indices can be linked to density, acoustic monitoring would provide a powerful and cost-effective census method for White-chinned Petrels and other nocturnal species.",Nocturnality;playback;vocalisation;passive acoustic monitoring (PAM);automatic classifier;seasonality,EMU-AUSTRAL ORNITHOLOGY,2022,JAN 2,Article,English,Ornithology

Using each of these character sets, separately or in combination, one can distinguish with 100\% confidence the new species from its sister lineages. The new species is known from only 5 localities distributed in 2 distinct mountain ranges, 1 on the eastern slopes of the Planalto da Conquista, between the municipalities of Boa Nova and Iguai, and another in the Serra das Lontras, similar to 100 km to the southeast and only 37 km from the coast. The new species primarily inhabits undisturbed montane forest, from 660 to 1,140 m a.s.l. We estimated an area of occupancy of the species of only 5,885 ha and a density of 0.49 individuals ha(-1), resulting in a total estimated population of 2,883 individuals. Forest remnants are under severe pressure from clandestine timber extraction and outright deforestation. Under IUCN criteria, this new species should be classified as ``Endangered.{''}",biogeography;conservation;endangered species;montane Atlantic Forest;Scytalopus;taxonomic revision;vocalizations,AUK,2014,OCT,Article,English,Ornithology

Echolocation calls of 69 cetaceans species has been obtained from different data sources. Through analysis by a Hierarchical Partitioning test, a non-parametric substitute of variance analysis, the absence of statistical differences between bioacoustic data sources has been demonstrated. Sounds were normalized and the fundamental frequency of each species was determined by autocorrelation. Also, the average swimming speed of each species was obtained from published papers. Finally, the intensity of the Doppler effect was calculated for each species using the mathematical equation of underwater sound physics. Doppler shifts lower than 160 Hz were found for the majority of species. This can be explained as a behavioral strategy to avoid depredation by Killer Whales. Only certain species of Ziphidae (genus Mesoplodon, Indopacetus pacificus and Ziphius cavirostris) and six species of Delphinidae (from Lagenorhynchus and Cephalorhynchus genus) present higher Doppler shifts. These species had found other strategies to avoid depredation such as the use of echolocation only in deep waters, very high average swimming speeds, large flocks or the use of very high frequencies. From these results it is possible to conclude that depredation conditions all the evolution of echolocation signals of cetaceans except in a reduced number of species that had developed different behavioral strategies to escape from Killer Whales.

The auditory biology of monk seals is compelling from behavioral, evolutionary, and conservation perspectives, but we presently lack substantive bioacoustic information for this species, with no formal descriptions of underwater vocalizations and limited data concerning hearing. These seals have been isolated for more than 10 million yr and have auditory structures differing from those of related species. Additionally, unlike other aquatically mating phocids, monk seals breed asynchronously and are not known to produce social calls in water. To address existing knowledge gaps, we trained a mature male Hawaiian monk seal to perform a psychophysical task while submerged. Detection thresholds were measured for narrowband sounds across the frequency range of hearing. We also conducted a year-round characterization of the seal's spontaneous underwater vocalizations. This individual demonstrated best hearing between 0.2 and 33 kHz, with a lower high-frequency roll-off than that of related species. Hearing at all frequencies was less sensitive than in other true seals. Despite the absence of conspecifics, the seal regularly produced 6 different underwater calls with energy below 1 kHz. Calling patterns reflected a period of annual reproductive activity lasting about 6 mo, coincident with elevated testosterone levels. This study presents the first examination of underwater vocalizations in Hawaiian monk seals, provides insight into the auditory abilities of this species and the evolution of underwater hearing among phocids, and enables improved assessments of noise effects on these vulnerable seals.",Hawaiian monk seal;Hearing;Audiogram;Communication;Vocal behavior,ENDANGERED SPECIES RESEARCH,2021,,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation

One interesting example of stick-slip friction is found in the soundproducing apparatus of many spiny lobster species (Palinuridae). The acoustic movements of the spiny lobster's plectrum over the file are generated by stick-slip friction between the two surfaces. We examined the microscopic anatomy, kinematics, acoustics and frictional properties of the California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) toward the goal of quantitatively characterizing the frictional and acoustic mechanics of this system. Using synchronous high-speed video and sound recordings, we tested whether plectrum kinematics are correlated with acoustic signal features and found that plectrum velocity is positively correlated with acoustic amplitude. To characterize the frictional mechanics of the system, we measured frictional forces during sound production using excised plectrums and files. Similar to rubber materials sliding against hard surfaces, the static coefficient of friction in this system was on average 1.7. The change in the coefficient of friction across each stick-slip cycle varied substantially with an average change of 1.1. Although driven at a constant speed, the plectrum slipped at velocities that were positively correlated with the normal force between the two surfaces. Studies of friction in biological systems have focused primarily on adhesion and movement, while studies of stick-slip acoustics have remained under the purview of musical acoustics and engineering design. The present study offers an integrative analysis of an unusual bioacoustic mechanism and contrasts its physical parameters with other biological and engineered systems.",friction;coefficient;sliding;static;sound;bioacoustics;lobsters;Palinuridae;Panulirus interruptus;stick;slip;tribology,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,2007,OCT 15,Article,English,Biology

The study was conducted in Nam Cat Tien National Park (southern Vietnam) from January 2013 to January 2014. We placed an autonomous recorder at the Nam Cat Tien ecosystem flux observation station at a height of 35 m. For the analysis, we selected 1-4 5-min recordings per day collected at 5.30 a.m., 12.00 a.m., 4.00 p.m., and 8.00 p.m. For each recording, we calculated four acoustic indices: the acoustic complexity index (ACI), the bioacoustic index (BIO), the acoustic diversity index (ADI) and the acoustic evenness index (AEI). These indices had roughly similar annual dynamics and peaked from May to August (i.e., immediately before the wet season and in the wet season). We then related the four acoustic indices to the daily values of the following meteorological variables: air temperature, air relative humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation sum. The BIO, ADI and AEI were most influenced by daily average humidity. We therefore concluded that humidity rather than precipitation, temperature or radiation was the best predictor of the annual dynamics of acoustic activity in Nam Cat Tien. The increase in humidity was apparent several months before the major rains began in 2013 (i.e., before the wet season).

Until now, it included 28 recognised species, of which more than half were described recently over the last five years. Our amphibian explorations have further revealed the presence of undescribed species of Nights Frogs in the southern Western Ghats. Based on integrated molecular, morphological and bioacoustic evidence, seven new species are formally described here as Nyctibatrachus athirappillyensis sp. nov., Nyctibatrachus manalari sp. nov., Nyctibatrachus pulivijayani sp. nov., Nyctibatrachus radcliffei sp. nov., Nyctibatrachus robinmoorei sp. nov., Nyctibatrachus sabarimalai sp. nov. and Nyctibatrachus webilla sp. nov., thereby bringing the total number of valid Nyctibatrachus species to 35 and increasing the former diversity estimates by a quarter. Detailed morphological descriptions, comparisons with other members of the genus, natural history notes, and genetic relationships inferred from phylogenetic analyses of a mitochondrial dataset are presented for all the new species. Additionally, characteristics of male advertisement calls are described for four new and three previously known species. Among the new species, six are currently known to be geographically restricted to low and mid elevation regions south of Palghat gap in the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and one is probably endemic to high-elevation mountain streams slightly northward of the gap in Tamil Nadu. Interestingly, four new species are also among the smallest known Indian frogs.

Pishing usually attracts multiple species when used in Holarctic habitats, but it produces limited responses in other regions. We propose that responses to pishing occur most often because the sound mimics predator scold calls of species in family Paridae, whose members are resident primarily in the Holarctic. Using both field playback of recorded alarm calls and pishing and bioacoustic analysis of calls, we tested three hypotheses: (1) a generalized mobbing response to parid scold calls has evolved among forest birds in the Holarctic region; (2) pishing generates overt predator mobbing behaviour in diverse avian taxa; (3) pishing generates mobbing behaviour because of its acoustic similarity to parid scold calls. In playback trials in northern California, scolds of local and exotic parids and pishing elicited more vigorous mobbing responses than did the alarm calls of local non-parid species. Parid scolds shared two frequency metrics distinct from non-parid calls, and pishing shared one frequency metric with parid calls that was distinct from non-parid calls. We provide support for a generalized (mobbing) response elicited in Holarctic bird communities by parid scolds that could explain similar close-approach responses to pishing and provide evidence that scold call structural similarity with pishing may underlie the shared behavioural responses. This is the first test of mechanisms underlying pishing responses that also yields an explanation of the geographic variability in strength of response.",acoustic similarity;generalized mobbing response;Holarctic;Paridae;pishing;response similarity;scold calls,ECOSCIENCE,2006,,Article,English,Ecology

Spatially and temporally coincident data were collected from a six-frequency bioacoustic system (Tracor Acoustic Profiling System ( TAPS)) and from a 1 m 2 Multiple Opening Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS). The combined net/acoustic tows were conducted over the Oregon continental shelf in August 2001, during both day and night.

Fine-scale vertical distributions of zooplankton that were resolved acoustically were not apparent within the integrated depth strata of the individual MOCNESS net samples. The taxonomic and size composition of the zooplankton community had strong effects on volume backscatter (S-V), although the magnitude of S-V was not linearly related to zooplankton biomass.

We previously reported an unusual pattern of ultrasonic vocalizations in BTBR pups that may represent a behavioral homolog to the second diagnostic symptom of autism, impaired communication. This study investigated the social and vocal repertoire in adult BTBR mice, to evaluate the role of ultrasonic vocalizations in multiple social situations at the adult stage of development. Three different social contexts were considered: male-female, male-male (resident-intruder) and female-female interactions. Behavioral responses and ultrasonic vocalizations were recorded for BTBR and for the highly social control strain C57BL/6J (B6). No episodes of overt fighting or mating were observed during the short durations of the three different experimental encounters. BTBR displayed lower levels of vocalizations and social investigation in all three social contexts as compared with B6. In addition, the correlation analyses between social investigation and ultrasonic vocalization emission rate showed that in B6 mice, the two variables were positively correlated in all the three different social settings, whereas in BTBR mice, the positive correlation was significant only in the male-female interactions. These findings strongly support the value of simultaneously recording two aspects of the mouse social repertoire: social motivation and bioacoustic communication.

We assess morphological, bioacoustic, and genetic variation of Madagascar's amphibians, one of the first near-complete taxon samplings from a biodiversity hotspot. Based on DNA sequences of 2,850 specimens sampled from over 170 localities, our analyses reveal an extreme proportion of amphibian diversity, projecting an almost 2-fold increase in species numbers from the currently described 244 species to a minimum of 373 and up to 465. This diversity is widespread geographically and across most major phylogenetic lineages except in a few previously well-studied genera, and is not restricted to morphologically cryptic clades. We classify the genealogical lineages in confirmed and unconfirmed candidate species or deeply divergent conspecific lineages based on concordance of genetic divergences with other characters. This integrative approach may be widely applicable to improve estimates of organismal diversity. Our results suggest that in Madagascar the spatial pattern of amphibian richness and endemism must be revisited, and current habitat destruction may be affecting more species than previously thought, in amphibians as well as in other animal groups.

The examined M, peraccae specimens are slightly warty dorsally, with small, dark protruding dots surrounding brown rounded patches on the light brown dorsum. Mantidactylus peraccae has a wide distribution in eastern Madagascar, occurring at elevations between 900 and 1800 m. M. brunae n, sp, inhabits the low-altitude rainforest of Andohahela and differs from M. peraccae in its slender form and smoother skin. In contrast to M. peraccae (which is arboreal), M. brunae n, sp. was found on the ground in crevices along rocky forest brooks. Its acoustic repertoire consists of a rapid trill-like series of 3-4 click notes with a frequency ranging from about 1.4 to 6.7 kHz, whereas M, peraccae emits metallic sounds, single or in series, from elevated positions. Morphological and bioacoustic differences between populations attributed to M. peraccae indicate that they may constitute more than one species, but available data are insufficient to corroborate taxonomic conclusions.

However, more development work and testing against traditional methods are needed to establish optimal working practices.Aims: This study aims to determine whether Capercaillie vocalizations can be recognized in lek recordings, whether this can be automated using readily available software, and whether the number of calls resulting varies with location, weather conditions, date and time of day.Methods: Unattended recording devices and semi-automated call classification software were used to record and analyse the display calls of Capercaillie at three known lek sites in Scotland over a two-week period.Results: Capercaillie calls were successfully and rapidly identified within a data set that included the vocalizations of other bird species and environmental noise. Calls could be readily recognized to species level using a combination of unsupervised software and manual analysis. The number of calls varied by time and date, by recorder/microphone location at the lek site, and with weather conditions. This information can be used to better target future acoustic monitoring and improve the quality of existing traditional lek surveys.Conclusion: Bioacoustic methods provide a practical and cost-effective way to determine habitat occupancy and activity levels by a vocally distinctive bird species.

One promising technique for studying migratory birds relies on microphones to record the nocturnal flight calls produced by birds on the wing. We compared recordings of night flight calls with bird-banding data in a southern Great Lakes ecosystem. We collected >6,200 hr of nocturnal recordings at 7 locations around Lake Erie. We detected >60,000 flight calls from migratory birds and classified 45,775 calls to species level or to a bioacoustic category comprising several species with similar calls. We compared these acoustic data with records of 5,624 birds captured in mist nets. We found that acoustic recordings accurately quantified the magnitude of migration; comparison with mist-net data revealed significant positive correlations between the number of acoustic detections and the number of mist-net detections across species. We also found that acoustic recordings accurately quantified the timing of migration; we found significant positive correlations between the date of passage of the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the populations of up to 25 groups of passage migrant species in the acoustic data and mist-net data. A careful examination of 6 species with distinctive flight calls revealed only subtle seasonal differences between peak detections via acoustic monitoring and mist netting, at both daily and weekly timescales.

Two species of particular interest are the resident, coastal Indian Ocean humpback dolphin Sousa plumbea and the migratory humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae. As the two species belong to different hearing groups (high-frequency odontocetes vs low-frequency mysticetes), we review the available literature on their differing hearing mechanisms (physiology), specialities and sensitivities here as there is a lack of data available for these two species in the Indian Ocean region. The reviewed information included audiogram data, species-specific frequencies and sensitivity ranges, ear morphology and adaptations for hearing in their respective groups where available. For odontocetes, most information stems from animals under human care, while for mysticetes bioacoustic measurements, like audiograms, are more difficult to access, resulting in a lack of data on hearing for M. novaeangliae. Our review highlights an absence of baselines upon which to measure future impacts from anthropogenic developments in the Indian Ocean and we suggest future work to address this. Our work is not only timely in view of the planned anthropogenic developments in the Indian Ocean, but also has wider implications in the global context as cumulative impacts on cetaceans grow due to increased international demand for resources and associated Ocean Economy developments.

Blommersia transmarina sp. nov. differs from its sister taxon, B. wittei, by several morphological differences including larger body size (snout-vent length up to 34.5 mm) and by slight differences in advertisement calls. Boophis nauticus sp. nov. differs from its closest relatives, B. tephraeomystax and B. doulioti, by slight morphological differences (including larger body size), a reddish (vs. silvery or golden) iris coloration in life, and slightly different advertisement calls. The two new species differ from their closest relatives by a substantial genetic differentiation, with pairwise genetic distances > 5\% in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, and based on the limited available data, also by distinct differences in nuclear DNA. They also are both larger than their closest relatives from Madagascar and B. transmarina sp. nov. is the largest Blommersia species, suggesting a moderate form of island gigantism.

Pollimyrus isidori migrated from a tributary of the Niger River (Mall) into a shallow (2-3 m) flood plain during the onset of the flooding seasons (August, 1991 and 1994). The fish were fully primed for reproduction upon entering the plain, females were significantly larger than males, and the sex ratio was skewed toward males (about 2 males per female). Males established territories (d approximate to 1 m) within the roots of floating rafts of grasses, about 0.5 m below the water surface. Males produced conspicuous acoustic displays consisting of Grunts and Moans during the night (130 dB peak re 1 mu Pa at approximately 10 cm). These sounds had a fundamental of 340 Hz, but the band-width of the grunt extended to over 3 kHz. Experiments at the field site with captive animals showed that male sound production was stimulated by the presence of conspecific females. The P. isidori repertoire included 3 additional sounds. Analysis of environmental noise showed that these communication sounds fall within a distinct spectral window, thereby minimizing potential interference from other aquatic animals and abiotic noise sources. Waveform analyses showed that the sounds remained coherent over short distances (0.5 m) but lost amplitude more rapidly than would be predicted in a deep water free-field.",animal communication;migration;electric fish;bioacoustics,BEHAVIOUR,1997,AUG,Article,English,Behavioral Sciences;Zoology

From 2014 to 2016, a series of underwater recordings were taken at field sites around Lizard Island in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Six individual fish choruses were identified where each chorus displayed distinct acoustic characteristics. Choruses exhibited diurnal activity and some field sites displayed consistently higher diversity of choruses and levels than others, suggesting that particular locations are important aggregation areas for soniferous fish species. During peak activity, choruses were a prominent component of reef soundscapes, where received levels of a chorus reached upwards of 120 dB re 1 mu Pa rms over the 450-650 Hz band, equating to a 40 dB increase above ambient noise levels of approximate to 80 dB re 1 mu Pa rms.Three out of the six detected choruses exhibited spectral and temporal characteristics similar to choruses previously documented at these sites and elsewhere, produced by planktivorous fish species. Three of these choruses appear to be undocumented and could hold information on the presence, abundance and dispersal patterns of important fish species, which may have potential long-term management applications.

This variation may contain important information used by animals for individual recognition. Suboscine birds are thought to develop song by fully innate mechanisms and are poorly studied relative to oscine birds, where song learning results in significant variation in song structure among individuals and the development of dialects. Recent research, however, demonstrates that suboscine song is often individually distinctive and in some cases shows signs of regional variation. We used spectrogram cross-correlation and canonical discriminant function analysis to examine individual and geographic variations in songs of Eastern Phoebes (Sayornis phoebe), suboscine birds with two song types. Both song types were individually distinctive and showed significantly higher cross-correlations within than among individuals. Discriminant function analysis correctly assigned 85.3\% of ``phee-bee{''} and 90.0\% of `` phee-b-be-bee{''} songs to the correct male, levels that are significantly higher than expected by chance. The individually distinctive characters of songs were also significantly repeatable among recording sessions. Eastern Phoebe song did not vary geographically between two populations separated by 640 km; permuted discriminant function analysis assigned 65\% of ``phee-bee{''} and 70\% of ``phee-b-be-bee{''} songs to the correct population, which did not differ significantly from chance expectations. Variation among males in song characteristics could be used by both males and females to discriminate among individuals. These detailed bioacoustic analyses support the idea that individual distinctive acoustic signals are widespread across suboscine birds.",Eastern Phoebe;discriminant function analysis;geographic variation in song;individual distinctiveness;spectrogram cross-correlation;suboscine,BIOACOUSTICS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SOUND AND ITS RECORDING,2013,,Article,English,Zoology

As the scepticism about CS data is still widespread, we analysed the development of a 3-year CS project based on the song of the Common Nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) to share best practices and lessons learned. We focused on the data scope, individual engagement, spatial distribution and species misidentifications from recordings generated before (2018, 2019) and during the COVID-19 outbreak (2020) with a smartphone using the `Naturblick' app. The number of nightingale song recordings and individual engagement increased steadily and peaked in the season during the pandemic. 13,991 nightingale song recordings were generated by anonymous (64\%) and non-anonymous participants (36\%). As the project developed, the spatial distribution of recordings expanded (from Berlin based to nationwide). The rates of species misidentifications were low, decreased in the course of the project (10-1\%) and were mainly affected by vocal similarities with other bird species. This study further showed that community engagement and data quality were not directly affected by dissemination activities, but that the former was influenced by external factors and the latter benefited from the app. We conclude that CS projects using smartphone apps with an integrated pattern recognition algorithm are well suited to support bioacoustic research in ornithology.

We analyzed genetic and phenotypic patterns and gene flow between two subspecies of the Eurasian magpie Pica pica s.l. which recently came into contact after presumably long periods of isolation. We describe the distribution of subspecies in a young contact zone at Argun' river basin in southern Siberia where populations occur in parapatry and an older hybrid population in eastern Mongolia. Based on genome-wide SNP data, we analyzed patterns and strength of gene flow between the subspecies. Our results indicate occasional hybridization with backcrossing and asymmetric introgression along a wide range in Transbaikalia and locally in eastern Mongolia. Males of P. p. jankowskii apparently exhibit higher dispersal ability towards the west compared to P. p. leucoptera (towards the east). The former occasionally migrates to eastern Mongolia and Transbaikalia where introgression of nuclear, but not mitochondrial DNA was evident. Bioacoustic investigations showed differences between the subspecies in speed and structure of vocalization. We discovered intermediate calls of hybrid magpies and bilingual birds alternating calls that are typical for the two taxa. Furthermore, we found dramatically decreased reproductive success in hybridogeneous populations. By complementing our results with established phylogeographic patterns of P. pica s.l. based on a mitochondrial marker sequence, and considering indications of sterility of hybrids in the contact zone, we propose to elevate the two corresponding subspecies to species level: P. pica for the western form and P. serica for the eastern form.",Hybridization;Reproductive isolation;Nuclear SNPs;ddRAD analysis;Control region of mtDNA;Phylogeography;Bioacoustics,ORGANISMS DIVERSITY \& EVOLUTION,2022,DEC,Article,English,Evolutionary Biology;Zoology

In birds, adverse effects include changes in vocalization patterns. Helicopters and songbirds are ubiquitous in protected natural areas but the effect of helicopter noise on songbirds has never been assessed. Objectives Our objective was to determine if helicopter noise affects temporal characteristics of songbird vocalizations within protected natural areas. Methods We collected soundscape recordings in three protected areas with varying levels of helicopter tour activity, including one with the second highest air tour activity in the United States. We examined songbird response to helicopter noise at the species level by measuring changes in vocalization time, and at the community level by employing the Bioacoustic Index, an acoustic measure of biological sound. Results We found a strong association between increasing helicopter noise and songbird vocalizations, indicating that some bird species use temporal shifts in vocalizations to mitigate masking effects from helicopter noise. The strength and direction of the response was species-specific, suggesting differences in resilience to helicopter noise between species. Furthermore, our results suggest that bird response to helicopter noise is strongest in areas with very loud and frequent helicopter traffic. Conclusions Our study is the first to examine and demonstrate impacts of helicopter noise on songbird vocalizations. Our results may serve as the foundation of an air tour management plan that considers reducing the number of helicopter overflights over protected natural areas and enforcing higher flight altitudes to decrease noise power levels.",Anthropogenic noise;Vocal plasticity;Noise pollution;Soundscape;Air tour management;Noise resilience,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,2021,MAR,Article,English,"Ecology;Geography, Physical;Geosciences, Multidisciplinary"

However, developments in acoustic recorders are enabling an important new approach for improved monitoring that is especially applicable for long-term studies, and for use in difficult environments or with cryptic species. Bioacoustic data may be effectively analysed within an occupancy modelling framework, as presence/absence can be determined, and repeated survey events can be accommodated. Hence, both occupancy and delectability estimates can be produced from large, coherent datasets. However, the most effective methods for the practical detection and identification of call data are still far from established. We assessed a novel combination of automated clustering and manual verification to detect and identify heathland bird vocalizations, covering a period of six days at 44 sampling locations. Occupancy (Psi) and delectability (p) were modelled for each species, and the best fit models provided values of: nightjar Psi = 0.684, p = 0.740, Dartford warbler Psi = 0.449, p = 0.196 and woodlark Psi = 0.13, p = 0.996. Including environmental covariates within the occupancy models indicated that tree, wetland and heather cover were important variables, particularly influencing delectability. The protocol used here allowed robust and consistent survey data to be gathered, with limited fieldwork resourcing, allowing population estimates to be generated for the target bird species. The combination of bioacoustics and occupancy modelling can provide a valuable new monitoring approach, allowing population trends to be identified, and the effects of environmental change and site management to be assessed.",Acoustic ecology;Autonomous recorder;Bird survey;Heathland;Occupancy model,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2020,MAY,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Environmental Sciences

However, recent studies have shown that amplitudes encode identity in a variety of mammal species. Previously, individuality has been demonstrated in both fundamental frequency (F-0) and amplitude changes of captive Eastern wolf (Canis lupus lycaon) howls with 100\% accuracy where attenuation of amplitude due to distance was controlled in a captive environment. In this study, we aim to determine whether both fundamental frequency and amplitude data collected from vocalizations of wild wolves recorded over unknown distances, in variable conditions and with different recording equipment, can still encode identity. We used a bespoke code, developed in Matlab, to extract simple scalar variables from 67 high-quality solo howls from 10 wild individuals and 112 chorus howls from another 109 individuals, including lower quality howls with wind or water noise. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out on the fundamental frequency and normalized amplitude of harmonic 1, yielding histogram-derived PCA values on which discriminant function analysis was applied. An accuracy of 100\% was achieved when assigning solo howls to individuals, and for the chorus howls a best accuracy of 97.4\% was achieved. We suggest that individual recognition using our new extraction and analysis methods involving fundamental frequency and amplitudes together can identify wild wolves with high accuracy, and that this method should be applied to surveys of individuals in capture-mark-recapture and presence-absence studies of canid species.",individuality;vocal recognition;wild wolf;howl;amplitude;Canis lupus lycaon,BIOACOUSTICS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SOUND AND ITS RECORDING,2014,JAN 2,Article,English,Zoology

Therefore, interest in noninvasive surveying techniques is growing among freshwater ecologists. Passive acoustic monitoring, the noninvasive recording of environmental sounds, has been shown to effectively survey biota in terrestrial and marine ecosystems. However, knowledge of the sounds produced by freshwater species is relatively scarce. Furthermore, little is known about the representation of different freshwater taxonomic groups and habitat types within the literature. Here we present results of a systematic review of research literature on freshwater bioacoustics and identify promising areas of future research. The review showed that fish are the focal taxonomic group in 44\% of published studies and were studied primarily in laboratory aquaria and lotic habitats. By contrast, lentic habitats and other taxonomic groups have received relatively little research interest. It is particularly striking that arthropods are only represented by 26\% of studies, despite their significant contributions to freshwater soundscapes. This indicates a mismatch between the representation of taxonomic groups within the freshwater bioacoustic literature and their relative acoustic contribution to natural freshwater soundscapes. In addition, the review indicates an ongoing shift from behavioral studies, often with focus on a single taxonomic group, towards field-based studies using ecoacoustic approaches. On the basis of this review we suggest that future freshwater bioacoustics research should focus on passive acoustic monitoring and arthropod sound, which would likely yield novel insights into freshwater ecosystem function and condition.

Now, many sources of data inform decisions in taxonomy, yet few studies are available that directly compare the conclusions made on the basis of different datasets. The difficulty of reaching clear taxonomic decisions is further complicated by the existence of allopatric populations, which may differ from other populations in notable ways yet not be distinct evolutionary units. We analyzed differences at the molecular level based on sequences of two mitochondrial genes, analyzed acoustic differences in male vocalizations (nine variables) and conducted a phonotaxis experiment with females to assess the taxonomic status of two putative Caribbean frog species (Mannophryne olmonae and Mannophryne trinitatis, Aromobatidae), which some authors have indicated as conspecific. A 16S gene tree (75 sequences of 15 putative species, 530 bp), a parametric bootstrap test, and the results of acoustic comparisons suggested that these entities were evolutionarily distinct. However, in the phonotaxis experiment, females of either species did not display significant preference among the male vocalizations presented. On the basis of the bioacoustic data and the 16S gene tree, we conclude that these taxa are distinct and suggest that lack of selection for pre-mating isolation in allopatry explains the lack of discrimination shown by females. Phonotaxis experiments in taxa with acoustic means of mate attraction should continue to be useful in assessing the evolutionary independence of putative sympatric entities, but our results suggest that they should be employed and interpreted cautiously when applied to allopatric populations. To most accurately assess the boundaries of evolutionary lineages, a pluralistic approach, utilizing as many sources of data as possible, is desirable.",allopatric populations;Anura;concordance;integrative taxonomy;Mannophryne;phonotaxis;Trinidad and Tobago;vocalization,JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY,2011,FEB,Article,English,Zoology

Using the lacunarity of the acquired DBS, the proposed classification method, namely LAC, introduces a texture-based approach that captures the differences in the distribution of FC, CC, and SQ across the breathing cycle, which may lead to more accurate characterization of the pulmonary acoustical changes due to the related pathology. Prior to the lacunarity analysis, wavelet-based denoising of DBS is employed to eliminate effects of the vesicular sound (background noise) to DBS oscillatory pattern. LAC analysis builds its classification power both upon the use of lacunarity at an optimum scale and the approximation of its trajectory across an optimum range of scales using a three-parameter hyperbola model. LAC is applied to 363 DBS corresponding to 25 cases included in four lung sound databases. Results show that LAC efficiently classifies the three DBS categories in the comparison groups of FC-CC, FC-SQ (both with mean accuracy of 100\%), CC-SQ (mean accuracy of 99.62\%-100\%), and FC-CC-SQ (mean accuracy of 99.75\%-100\%). When compared to other classification tools, LAC seems quite attractive, since, without employing high computational complexity, it results in high classification accuracy. Moreover, LAC introduces a ``texture{''} concept in the analysis of breath sounds, something that strongly relates to the perception of the bioacoustic signals by the physician. Due to its simplicity, LAC could be implemented in a real-time context and be used in clinical medicine as a module of an integrated intelligent patient evaluation system.",Discontinuous breath sounds (DBSs);fine crackles (FCs)/coarse crackles (CCs);lactinarity analysis;squawks (SQs);texture-based classification,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING,2009,MAR,Article,English,"Engineering, Biomedical"

Simultaneously, there has been extensive research into methods for efficiently extracting signals of interest from the acoustic data sets that accrue from the deployment of ARUs. For some species, bioacoustic monitoring supported by computerised signal detection offers the only effective and efficient method for widespread survey. In these circumstances, the detection space of both the ARU and the performance of the signal detection process must be considered concurrently, but typically, these two elements have been considered separately. Here, using the Night Parrot (Pezoporus occidentalis) as a case study, we consider both ARU detection space and the signal detection process to develop a robust and repeatable survey protocol for the species. After developing a call recogniser for the Night Parrot, we test its performance on a data set of Night Parrot calls given at a known distance from an array of ARUs. Having established a relationship between ARU type, recogniser performance and distance, we determine the sampling radius of an ARU for a given recogniser score cut-off, and the associated probability of detecting a Night Parrot that calls within that sampling radius. Using these data, we outline how to develop a robust and repeatable survey protocol for the Night Parrot, with a defined probability of detection.

Hybridization can also occur more frequently in declining populations, as there is a smaller pool of conspecific mates from which to choose. Here, we report an unusual combination of factors that has resulted in a rare, three-species hybridization event among two genera of warblers, one of which is experiencing significant population declines. We use bioacoustic, morphometric and genetic data, to demonstrate that an early generation female hybrid between a golden-winged warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) and a blue-winged warbler (V. cyanoptera) went on to mate and successfully reproduce with a chestnut-sided warbler (Setophaga pensylvanica). We studied the product of this event-a putative chrysoptera x cyanoptera x pensylvanica hybrid-and show that this male offspring sang songs like S. pensylvanica, but had morphometric traits similar to Vermivora warblers. The hybrid's maternal parent had V. chrysoptera mitochondrial DNA and, with six plumage-associated loci, we predicted the maternal parent's phenotype to show that it was likely an early generation Vermivora hybrid. That this hybridization event occurred within a population of Vermivora warblers in significant decline suggests that females may be making the best of a bad situation, and that wood-warblers in general have remained genetically compatible long after they evolved major phenotypic differences.",hybridization;birds;reproductive isolation,BIOLOGY LETTERS,2018,NOV,Article,English,Biology;Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

We examined the variation of morphology genetics, and colouration in specimens affiliated to P. caryophyllaceus from Panama, using different Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) based on molecular phylogenetic lineages. Phylogeny, ecology, and distributional information for this species shed light on the position and species delineation of P. caryophyllaceus and its congeners in Panama. Our results demonstrate a high level of genetic diversity in P caryophyllaceus-like populations from Panama, which in fact comprise three main lineages that are geographically separated. Specimens from eastern Panama tend to be larger, with more expanded finger disks and toe pads than specimens from western Panama. However, aside from the significant morphological differences between MOTUs, the extent of variation within each MOTU is very large. Based on our extensive and integrative analysis, we suggest treating the three MOTUs of P. caryophyllaceus populations as a single polymorphic species with very deep conspecific lineages as a result of the dynamic geological history of the Isthmus of Panama.

However, for many larger species of estuarine fish, marine mammals that use echolocation to forage represent a significant threat. We hypothesized that seagrasses may serve as an acoustic refuge to fish from dolphin predators by sufficiently attenuating the high-frequency sounds used in echolocation. To test this hypothesis, we measured the attenuation of a 100 kHz acoustic signal with increasing distance into a seagrass meadow. The transmission loss of low-frequency sound energy relevant to fish calls (300 to 500 Hz) was also investigated to address the hypothesis that marine mammals may use passive acoustic detection to locate fish in vegetated substrates. Our results show that seagrasses attenuate high-frequency sounds during summer months and reduce prey detection thresholds by 58 to 88\% relative to bare substrates. Also, based on the low-frequency hearing threshold of bottlenose dolphins, we calculated that dolphins are capable of detecting low-frequency fish calls within vegetation at a distance of roughly 2.3 to 4.2 m, which is within the detection threshold of 2.8 to 9.8 m for dolphins using echolocation.

Eight species (Xenopus victorianus, Amietophrynus regularis, Ptychadena anchietae, R porosissima, Kassina senegalensis, Afrixalus quadrivittatus, Hyperolius kivuensis, H. lateralis) were taxonomically identified. The remaining seven species (three species of Hyperolius, two Phynobatrachus, one Amietia, one Ptychadena) represent undescribed or currently unrecognized taxa, suggesting a significant magnitude of overlooked amphibian diversity in Afromontane communities. Acoustic niche analysis of the 14 species producing airborne advertisement calls integrated the spatial dimension, i.e. the microhabitat used for calling, the temporal dimension, i.e. the time of day when calling takes place, and the call structure dimension, i.e. the physical features of the advertisement call. Average standardized acoustic niche breadth was narrow (measured: 0.08, predicted: 0.07) and showed low variability (0.04-0.16) among species, which means that empirical data are in full agreement with the predictions of stochastic niche theory for species-saturated communities. Niche segregation was mainly based on advertisement call features, whereas spatial and temporal niche dimension contributed less. Measured average niche overlap (0.30) was intermediate between random overlap (0.51) and minimum possible overlap (0.11), indicating significant acoustic resource partitioning. The only taxon group with widely overlapping acoustic niches were Ptychadena spp., which might indicate a recent invasion of the community by one or two of the three species.",advertisement call;stochastic niche theory;species saturation;cryptic diversity,AFRICAN ZOOLOGY,2012,APR,Article,English,Zoology

Automated signal detectors and classifiers are needed to identify events within these datasets, such as the presence of species-specific sounds or anthropogenic noise. These automated methods, however, are rarely a complete substitute for expert analyst review. The ability to visualize and annotate acoustic events efficiently can enhance scientific insights from large, previously intractable datasets. A MATLAB-based graphical user interface, called DetEdit, was developed to accelerate the editing and annotating of automated detections from extensive acoustic datasets. This tool is highly-configurable and multipurpose, with uses ranging from annotation and classification of individual signals or signal-clusters and evaluation of signal properties, to identification of false detections and false positive rate estimation. DetEdit allows users to step through acoustic events, displaying a range of signal features, including time series of received levels, long-term spectral averages, time intervals between detections, and scatter plots of peak frequency, RMS, and peak-to-peak received levels. Additionally, it displays either individual, or averaged sound pressure waveforms, and power spectra within each acoustic event. These views simultaneously provide analysts with signal-level detail and encounter-level context. DetEdit creates datasets of signal labels for further analyses, such as training classifiers and quantifying occurrence, abundances, or trends. Although designed for evaluating underwater-recorded odontocete echolocation click detections, DetEdit can be adapted to almost any stereotyped impulsive signal.

Research in Colombia and Ecuador indicates that centrolenid diversity is higher in the northern Andes. However, part of this trend appears to be due to sampling effort. We conducted fieldwork throughout northern Peru, and based on phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences, combined with bioacoustic and morphological analyses of new and available material we now recognize 33 species from the country (versus 30 species prior to this work). Field surveys led to the discovery of four remarkable species: Centrolene charapita new species is a large, ornamented glassfrog that appears to be sister to Ce. geckoideum; Chimerella corleone new species represents the second-known member of the genus Chimerella; Cochranella guayasamini new species is the second-known member of the genus with humeral spines; and Hyalinobatrachium anachoretus new species occurs in the cloud forest of the east-Andean versant in Peru. In addition to the new species described here, we provide new country records, new localities including range extensions of up to 875 km, information on diagnostic characters and phylogenetic relationships, call and larval descriptions, and observations on natural history for several Peruvian centrolenids. Our results also revealed several taxonomic problems concerning species of the genus Rulyrana, and we conclude that R. croceopodes and R. tangarana are junior synonyms of R. saxiscandens. By implication of our phylogenetic analyses, we recognize the following new combinations: Espadarana audax new combination, Espadarana durrelorum new combination, and Espadarana fernandoi new combination.",Amphibians;Bioacoustics;Biodiversity;Integrative taxonomy;New species;Phylogenetics;Peru,ZOOTAXA,2014,AUG 12,Article,English,Zoology

However, sounds have only been recorded from a low proportion of taxa within the family. Here, we used quantitative bioacoustic, morphological and phylogenetic methods to characterize vocal behavior and mechanisms in the three-spined toadfish, Batrachomoeus trispinosus. B. trispinosus produced two types of sound: long-duration `hoots' and short-duration `grunts' that were multiharmonic, amplitude and frequency modulated, with a dominant frequency below 1 kHz. Grunts and hoots formed four major classes of calls. Hoots were typically produced in succession as trains, while grunts occurred either singly or as grunt trains. Aside from hoot trains, grunts and grunt trains, a fourth class of calls consisted of single grunts with acoustic beats, apparently not previously reported for individuals from any teleost taxon. Beats typically had a predominant frequency around 2kHz with a beat frequency around 300Hz. Vocalizations also exhibited diel and lunar periodicities. Spectrographic cross-correlation and principal coordinates analysis of hoots from five other toadfish species revealed that B. trispinosus hoots were distinct. Unlike any other reported fish, B. trispinosus had a bilaterally divided swimbladder, forming two separate swimbladders. Phylogenetic analysis suggested B. trispinosus was a relatively basal batrachoidid, and the swimbladder and acoustic beats were independently derived. The swimbladder in B. trispinosus demonstrates that toadfishes have undergone a diversification of peripheral sonic mechanisms, which may be responsible for the concomitant innovations in vocal communication, namely the individual production of acoustic beats as reported in some tetrapods.",acoustic communication;courtship;functional morphology;ontogeny;phylogeny;sound production;swimbladder;vocalization,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,2009,MAY 1,Review,English,Biology

Continuous surveys of seabirds were conducted simultaneously in June (onset of upwelling) and August (mature phase of upwelling) with ocean properties quantified using a towed, undulating vehicle and a multi-frequency bioacoustic instrument (38-420 kHz). Twelve species of seabirds contributed 99\% of the total community density and biomass. Species composition and densities were similar to those recorded elsewhere in the CCS during earlier studies of the upwelling season. At a scale of 2-4 km, physical and biological oceanographic variables explained an average of 25\% of the variation in the distributions and abundance of the 12 species. The most important explanatory variables (among 14 initially included in each multiple regression model) were distance to upwelling-derived frontal features (center and edge of coastal jet, and an abrupt, inshore temperature gradient), sea-surface salinity, acoustic backscatter representing various sizes of prey (smaller seabird species were associated with smaller prey and the reverse for larger seabird species), and chlorophyll concentration. We discuss the importance of these variables in the context of what factors seabirds may use to find food. The high seabird density in the Heceta Bank and Cape Blanco areas indicates them to be refuges contrasting the low seabird densities currently found in most other parts of the CCS, following decline during the recent warm regime of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.

In large areas of the planet, however, glaciations have had the opposite effect, but here their impacts are much less well understood. This is especially true in Southeast Asia, where cyclical changes in land distribution have generated enormous land expansions during glacial periods. In this study, we selected a panel of five songbird species complexes covering a range of ecological specificities to investigate the effects Quaternary land bridges have had on the connectivity of Southeast Asian forest biota. Specifically, we combined morphological and bioacoustic analysis with an arsenal of population genomic and modelling approaches applied to thousands of genome-wide DNA markers across a total of hundreds of individuals. Our analyses show that species dependent on forest understorey exhibit deep differentiation between Borneo and western Sundaland, with no evidence of gene flow during the land bridges accompanying the last 1-2 ice ages. In contrast, dispersive canopy species and habitat generalists have experienced more recent gene flow. Our results argue that there remains much cryptic species-level diversity to be discovered in Southeast Asia even in well-known animal groups such as birds, especially in nondispersive forest understorey inhabitants. We also demonstrate that Quaternary land bridges have not been equally suitable conduits of gene flow for all species complexes and that life history is a major factor in predicting relative population divergence time across Quaternary climate fluctuations.",climate change;connectivity;cross island gene flow;Sundaland,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2020,JUL,Article,English,Biochemistry \& Molecular Biology;Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

Bioacoustic recordings can have historical as well as scientific value and should be assessed for their conservation requirements. Unpreserved bioacoustics recordings are generally not referenced and are frequently at high risk of loss by material degradation and/or by misplacement. In this study we investigated the preservation status of sets of natural sound recordings made in Portugal from 1983 until 2010 inclusive. We evaluated the recordings on the basis of their rate of loss, the degree to which unpreserved recordings could be preserved, and their risk of loss. Recordists of animal sounds were surveyed (by questionnaire or interview) to identify sets of recordings and to collect information on their quality and state of preservation. Of the 78 recordists identified, we found that 32\% of the recordings have an unclear status and that only 9\% of the recordings are lost. Of the c. 6 terabytes of unpreserved sound recordings discovered, an estimated 49\% were recoverable. Moreover, 95\% of the recoverable sets of recordings were at high risk of loss by their being misplaced. These risks can be minimized if recordists are persuaded to deposit their material in an institution committed to long-term curation of such data (e. g. sound archives). Overall, the study identified a considerable body of unpreserved animal sound recordings that could contribute to our scientific heritage and knowledge of the biodiversity found in Portugal. It highlights the need to implement effective policies to promote the deposit of recordings for preservation and to reverse the present scenario so that scientific material can be preserved for future generations.",,PLOS ONE,2014,DEC 4,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

Background: Many designs of prosthesis are available for middle ear surgery. The materials used, and the shape of the implants, differ widely. Advances in computer simulation technologies offer the possibility of replicating the in vivo behavior of the different prostheses. If this can be achieved, insight into the design attributes required for improved biofunctionality may be gained. Methods: Micro-computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging were used to obtain geometric information that was translated into a finite element model of the outer and middle ear. The forced frequency response across the hearing range of the normal middle ear was compared with the middle ear reconstructed with partial and total ossicular replacement prostheses. Results: The amplitude of vibration of the footplate was more similar to that of the normal ear when a Kurz total ossicular replacement prosthesis was implanted than when a Xomed total ossicular replacement prosthesis was implanted. This may be attributed to the latter's titanium link. Partial ossicular replacement prostheses were stiffest and had lower umbo vibrations and higher stapedial footplate vibrations. In all cases but one, the vibration of the prostheses had resonances that caused the vibration of the stapes footplate to be noticeably different from normal. Conclusion: The authors confirmed the hypothesis that finite element modeling can be used to predict the differences in the response of ossicular replacement prostheses. This study shows that computer simulation can potentially be used to test or optimize the vibroacoustic characteristics of middle ear implants.",finite element modeling;ossicular replacement prostheses;computer simulation;middle ear implants,OTOLOGY \& NEUROTOLOGY,2003,JAN,Article,English,Clinical Neurology;Otorhinolaryngology

Cephalopods are an ecologically key taxon that likely use sound and may be impacted by increasing anthropogenic ocean noise, but little is known regarding their behavioral responses or adaptations to sound stimuli. These experiments identify the acoustic range and levels that elicit a wide range of secondary defense behaviors such as inking, jetting and rapid coloration change. Secondarily, it was found that cuttlefish habituate to certain sound stimuli. The present study examined the behavioral responses of 22 cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) to pure-tone pips ranging from 80 to 1000 Hz with sound pressure levels of 85-188 dB re. 1 mu Pa rms and particle accelerations of 0-17.1 m s(-2). Cuttlefish escape responses (inking, jetting) were observed between frequencies of 80 and 300 Hz and at sound levels above 140 dB re. 1 mu Pa rms and 0.01 m s(-2) (0.74 m s(-2) for inking responses). Body patterning changes and fin movements were observed at all frequencies and sound levels. Response intensity was dependent upon stimulus amplitude and frequency, suggesting that cuttlefish also possess loudness perception with a maximum sensitivity around 150 Hz. Cuttlefish habituated to repeated 200 Hz tone pips, at two sound intensities. Total response inhibition was not reached, however, and a basal response remained present in most animals. The graded responses provide a loudness sensitivity curve and suggest an ecological function for sound use in cephalopods.",Bioacoustics;Cephalopod;Hearing;Noise;Loudness;Invertebrate;Ear;Statocyst;Lateral line,JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY,2014,DEC,Article,English,Biology

Since most of the scarcely published records date back about seven decades, our objectives were (1) to confirm its presence at the type locality, (2) to explore other potentially suitable areas, (3) to collect information on morphology and field characteristics, behaviour and habitat, (4) to conclude on its taxonomic position, and (5) to make a preliminary assessment of threats to the birds and their habitat. We recorded at least 12 different Black-fronted Francolin individuals on five sites around the town of Mega (04 degrees 03'28{''} N 38 degrees 19'16{''} E). The birds inhabited semi-open woodland between 1,480 and 2,223 m asl, where the original juniper forest has almost vanished because of heavy utilisation pressure, primarily by the expansion of agriculture, grazing and harvesting of firewood and timber. A typical external feature of the males is a clearly visible bald yellow patch behind the eye. While no other P castaneicollis subspecies seems to have this spot, other francolin species have. Additionally, our molecular and bioacoustic data support the separate taxonomic status of atrifrons. Taking together all characters, assigning species status for the Black-fronted Francolin is justified. Based on our survey, we estimate the current population to be very small, rendering the Black-fronted Francolin the most endangered galliform bird of Africa. Also, we assume its range to be much smaller and more fragmented than previously thought, making the local populations crucially endangered.",Ethiopia;Pternistis;Francolinus;Juniperus forest;habitat degradation;conservation,VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY,2014,JUL,Article,English,Zoology

The insectivorous bats of Madagascar are understudied in comparison to the rest of the island's fauna, and very little is known about their habitat use. Here, we used a remote bioacoustic surveying technique in a bat survey of the Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park, northwest Madagascar, to study constant frequency echolocating bats (Hipposideridae and Rhinonycteridae). We used two passive acoustic monitoring units to automatically record bat activity from dusk until dawn in a range of habitat types that are characteristic of the region. Analysis of call acoustic parameters revealed three distinct constant-frequency phonic types within the national park, which we identified as Commerson's leaf-nosed bat (Macronycteris commersoni), the red trident bat (Triaenops menamena) and an unknown phonic type of ca. 78 kHz. We found significant differences in the habitat usage of these three species, suggesting species-specific habitat preferences among Madagascar's bats. Our statistical analyses revealed significant differences between the acoustic echolocation calls of these three phonic types. The 78 kHz calls do not match any of the other constant frequency-calling bat species currently described for Madagascar, indicating either acoustic divergence among bat sub-populations or the possible existence of a new undescribed species. These results highlight the need for increased survey efforts to gain an understanding of species-specific geographic distributions and habitat usage among Malagasy bats and to disentangle their cryptic species complexes.",survey;echolocation;cryptic diversity;CF bats;habitat preference,ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA,2021,JUN,Article,English,Zoology

Soundscapes approaches-the recording and analysis of sounds in a landscape-could address this shortcoming. In 2011, a massive wildfire named ``the Horseshoe 2 Burn{''} occurred in the Chiricahua National Monument, Arizona, USA. We evaluated the impact of this wildfire on acoustic activity of animal communities. In 2013, soundscape recordings were collected over 9 months in 12 burned and 12 non-burned sites in four ecological systems. The seasonal and diel biological acoustic activity were described using the ``Bioacoustic Index{''}, a detailed aural analysis of sound sources, and a new tool called ``Sonic Timelapse Builder{''} (STLB). Seasonal biophony phenology showed a diurnal peak in June and a nocturnal peak in October in all ecological systems. On June mornings, acoustic activity was lower at burned than at non-burned sites in three of four ecological systems, due to a decreased abundance of cicadas directly impacted by the death of trees. Aural analyses revealed that 55\% of recordings from non-burned sites contained insect sounds compared to 18\% from burned sites. On October nights, orthopteran activity was more prevalent at some burned sites, possibly due to post-fire emergence of herbaceous. Soundscape approaches can help address long-term conservation issues involving the responses of animal communities to wildfire.

Departures from this relationship can be used to infer call function, but research into inter-sexual call differences, as with song function in general, has been restricted by a bias towards male passerines. The nocturnal and flightless New Zealand kiwi (Apterygidae) are acoustically similar but taxonomically and ecologically very different from other birds, so provide a contrast in exploring avian call function and evolution. However, kiwi acoustic ecology is poorly understood, with the calls of only one of the five kiwi species spectrally described, and acoustic differences between the sexes virtually unknown. We conducted the first bioacoustic study of Little Spotted Kiwi Apteryx owenii, and assessed sexual call dimorphism in this species. There were significant inter-sexual differences in call temporal and frequency characteristics that were not related to size dimorphism. Contribution to duets and variation in temporal structure with call context also differed between the sexes. We suggest that these differences indicate divergent call function, with male calls more suited for territory defence, and female calls for pair contact. There was a striking lack of overlap in the frequency spectrum distributions of male and female calls, which was also unrelated to size and was further emphasized by the presence of formants in female calls. We propose that this provides evidence for inter-sexual acoustic cooperation in call frequency, of a type which to our knowledge has not previously been described in birds.

Assessing the relative importance of these forcings is challenging and requires analyses of multifaceted observational data. As part of the U.S. GLOBEC Georges Bank program, a series of cruises were conducted in fall 1997, 1998, and 1999 to survey diapausing populations of Calanus finmarchicus and their predators in Wilkinson, Jordan, and Georges Basins of the Gulf of Maine. Station and underway sampling were conducted using net (1 m(2) MOCNESS) and bioacoustic (BIOMAPER-II) systems, respectively, to acquire vertically stratified data for zooplankton biomass, taxonomic, size, and life-stage composition, together with associated environmental data. The results show that the autumn diapausing C. finmarchicus abundance was much lower in 1998 than in 1997 or 1999, even though the overall zooplankton biomass levels were comparable between the three years. The size frequency distribution of the diapausing individuals had a bi-modal pattern in 1997 and 1999, but a single mode in 1998, indicating the demise of an early cohort of the diapausing stock. The relative biomass and computed energy demand of potential invertebrate predators (euphausiids, decapods, medusae, and siphonophores) was found to be higher in 1998 and could account for the missing C. finmarchicus cohort.

Fin whale calls were detected from January through July when sea ice was present on the latter dates. No temporal segregation in peaks of diel calling rates of blue and fin whales was observed in autumn, but a clear temporal segregation was apparent in summer. Acoustic propagation models suggest that blue and fin whale calls can be heard as far as 1700 km from the hydrophone position in spring.

Songs of thrush nightingale and common nightingale differ significantly in many parameters. The intraspecific geographical variation of the song is much more expressed in common nightingale. Iranian and Turkestan subspecies were similar to a greater extent than each of them was similar to European subspecies. The most important difference of the latter concerns the initial part of their songs. Males of European subspecies usually perform a special vocal complex formed mainly by single (non-repeating) notes in the beginning of each song. In contrast, males of Iranian and Turkestan subspecies do not perform individual notes continuously changing each other and prefer a series of notes or syllables (trill). Thus, common nightingale differs from thrush nightingale in much deeper population-geographical differentiation both on morphological and bioacoustic characteristics. These differences could be due to historical reasons. Settling of thrush nightingale in Eastern Europe and Western Siberia, where the main part of the area of this species is located, could occur only in the postglacial period, i.e. relatively recently. A significant part of the common nightingale range is in the areas that were not directly exposed to glaciation.

Understanding their behavior relies on multi-channel and high-sampling-rate underwater acoustic recordings for identifying and tracking them in a passive way. However, a lot of energy and data storage is required, requiring frequent human maintenance operations. To cope with these constraints, an ultra-low power mixed-signal always-on wake-up is proposed. Based on pulse-pattern analysis, it can be used for triggering a multi-channel high-performance recorder only when cetacean clicks are detected, thus increasing autonomy and saving storage space. This detector is implemented as a mixed architecture making the most of analog and digital primitives: this combination drastically improves power consumption by processing high-frequency data using analog features and lower-frequency ones in a digital way. Furthermore, a bioacoustic expert system is proposed for improving detection accuracy (in ultra-low-power) via state machines. Power consumption of the system is lower than 30 mu W in always-on mode, allowing an autonomy of 2 years on a single CR2032 battery cell with a high detection accuracy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve obtained has an area under curve of 85\% using expert rules and 75\% without it. This implementation provides an excellent trade-off between detection accuracy and power consumption. Focused on sperm whales, it can be tuned to detect other species emitting pulse trains. This approach facilitates biodiversity studies, reducing maintenance operations and allowing the use of lighter, more compact and portable recording equipment, as large batteries are no longer required. Additionally, recording only useful data helps to reduce the dataset labeling time.",embedded artificial intelligence;ultra-low power;pattern detection;expert system;biosonar;always-on wake-up;pulse train,ELECTRONICS,2021,APR,Article,English,"Computer Science, Information Systems;Engineering, Electrical \& Electronic;Physics, Applied"

The goal of our study was to examine a suite of published acoustic indices to determine whether they provide comparable results relative to varying levels of landscape fragmentation and ecological condition in nineteen forest sites in eastern Australia. Our comparison of six acoustic indices according to time of day revealed that two indices, the acoustic complexity and the bioacoustic index, presented a similar pattern that was linked to avian song intensity, but was not related to landscape and biodiversity attributes. The diversity indices, acoustic entropy and acoustic diversity, and the normalized difference soundscape index revealed high nighttime sound, as well as a dawn and dusk chorus. These indices appear to be sensitive to nocturnal biodiversity which is abundant at night in warm, subtropical environments. We argue that there is need to better understand temporal partitioning of the soundscape by specific taxonomic groups, and this should involve integrated research on amphibians, insects and birds during a 24 h cycle. The three indices that best connected the soundscape with landscape characteristics, ecological condition and bird species richness were acoustic entropy, acoustic evenness and the normalized difference soundscape index. This study has demonstrated that remote soundscape assessment can be implemented as an ecological monitoring tool in fragmented Australian forest landscapes. However, further investigation should be dedicated to refining and/or combining existing acoustic indices and also to determine if these indices are appropriate in other landscapes and for other survey purposes.

Advancements in bioacoustic technology enable automated surveys that can supplement human-based point-count surveys with expanded temporal and spatial coverage. We surveyed birds in 13 Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range (CA, USA) montane meadows from May to August 2006 using 8 point-count surveys and automated audio recorders (ARU) to compare species richness between the 2 methods and evaluate the use of ARUs as a monitoring tool. We analyzed species richness using 30 minutes of ARU data per point and 2 point-count surveys. Automated audio-recorder data revealed 14 species per meadow (56 species total) while point counts detected 16 species per meadow (67 species total). Automated audio recorders provided > 1,100 additional hours of data with personnel effort similar to 2 point-count surveys. An asymptote in species richness was reached for every meadow using ARU data and 8 of 13 meadows using 2 point-count surveys. We detected 81 species during all 8 point-count surveys. We used SonoBird (DNDesign, Arcata, CA) software to search for 24 species detected by point-count surveys but not in the manually sampled subset of audio files. We detected 22 additional species, bringing the total audio-file species detections to 85, 4 more than detected by 8 point-count surveys. We conclude that audio recordings and analysis provide an alternative to avian point-count surveys or as a supplement to increase their accuracy, particularly over larger temporal and spatial scales, or for species with low detectability.

Within bioacoustics research, there has been a large number of recent studies that use CNNs. Designing CNN architectures from scratch is non-trivial and requires knowledge of machine learning. Furthermore, hyper-parameter tuning associated with CNNs is extremely time consuming and requires expensive hardware. In this paper we assess whether it is possible to build good bioacoustic classifiers by adapting and re-using existing CNNs pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset - instead of designing them from scratch, a strategy known as transfer learning that has proved highly successful in other domains. This study is a first attempt to conduct a large-scale investigation on how transfer learning can be used for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), to simplify the implementation of CNNs and the design decisions when creating them, and to remove time consuming hyper-parameter tuning phases. We compare 12 modern CNN architectures across 4 passive acoustic datasets that target calls of the Hainan gibbon Nomascus hainanus, the critically endangered black-and-white ruffed lemur Varecia variegata, the vulnerable Thyolo alethe Chamaetylas choloensis, and the Pin-tailed whydah Vidua macroura. We focus our work on data scarcity issues by training PAM binary classification models very small datasets, with as few as 25 verified examples.

Such recordings also open a window into how species behave and compete for niche space in the sensory environment. These opportunities are associated with new challenges: the volume and velocity of such data require new approaches to species identification and visualization. Here we introduce a newly-initiated acoustic monitoring network across the subtropical island of Okinawa, Japan, as part of the broader OKEON (Okinawa Environmental Observation Network) project. Our aim is to monitor the acoustic environment of Okinawa's ecosystems and use these space-time data to better understand ecosystem dynamics. We present a pilot study based on recordings from five field sites conducted over a one-month period in the summer. Our results provide a proof of concept for automated species identification on Okinawa, and reveal patterns of biogenic vs. anthropogenic noise across the landscape. In particular, we found correlations between forest land cover and detection rates of two culturally important species in the island soundscape: the Okinawa Rail and Ruddy Kingfisher. Among the soundscape indices we examined, NDSI, Acoustic Diversity and the Bioacoustic Index showed both diurnal patterns and differences among sites.

Two automated methods for acoustic classification of bird species currently used are frame-based methods, a model that uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and event-based methods, a model consisting of descriptive measurements or restricted to tonal or harmonic vocalizations. In this work, we propose a new method for automated field recording analysis with improved automated segmentation and robust bird species classification. We used a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based frame selection with an event-energy-based sifting procedure that selected representative acoustic events. We employed a Mel, band-pass filter bank on each event's spectrogram. The output in each subband was parameterized by an autoregressive (AR) model, which resulted in a feature consisting of all model coefficients. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used for classification. The significance of the proposed method lies in the parameterized features depicting the species specific spectral pattern. This experiment used a control audio dataset and real-world audio dataset comprised of field recordings of eleven bird species from the Xeno-canto Archive, consisting of 2762 bird acoustic events with 339 detected ``unknown{''} events (corresponding to noise or unknown species vocalizations). Compared with other recent approaches, our proposed method provides comparable identification performance with respect to the eleven species of interest. Meanwhile, superior robustness in real-world scenarios is achieved, which is expressed as the considerable improvement from 0.632 to 0.928 for the F-score metric regarding the ``unknown{''} events.

,INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF UNDERWATER NOISE,"Erbe,Christine",Curtin University,"Underwater noise is a by-product of marine industrial operations, that plays an increasing role in environmental impact assessments. It can have a variety of temporary to chronic bioacoustic impacts on marine fauna, such as behaviour modification, changes in habitat usage or migration, communication masking, and auditory and non-auditory physiological impacts. There are still lots of unknowns. Audiograms (curves of hearing sensitivity) have only been measured of few individuals of about 20 marine mammal species, and even fewer individuals and species of other marine genera. No audiograms exist for sperm whales or baleen whales. Behavioural responses likely depend on prior experience (habituation versus sensitisation), age, gender, health, context, current behavioural state etc., but we don't understand the details or mechanisms. Data on hearing loss and acoustic trauma is even scarcer. Finally, what is the biological significance of individual acoustic impacts? Environmental agencies and regulators struggle for data to support environmental management. Research on the impacts of underwater noise is being undertaken around the globe, but there is a substantial delay in publication and science transfer. In the face of uncertainty, what is being done? This article aims to provide a brief overview of underwater noise regulation in Australia and overseas. Regulations vary from country to country. Some jurisdictions use specific do-not-exceed thresholds, which are very broadly applied across differing species and environments, and sound sources. Others use more conceptual requirements such as `minimising impact to acceptable levels', yet what this means has to be defined and demonstrated by each proponent for their specific situation (i.e., operation, environment and organisms).

Within Philautus, reproduction has been described via endotrophic tadpoles and by direct terrestrial development. Here, we provide results of phylogenetic analyses based on the most comprehensive sampling of Bornean Philautus to date. As a result of an integrative taxonomic study using mitochondrial and nuclear markers, along with morphological and bioacoustic data, we describe a spectacular new species of this genus from the island of Borneo. The ecology of the new species of Philautus is closely associated with the carnivorous pitcher plant, Nepenthes mollis. The unusually large eggs are laid in the fluid of the pitcher and the endotrophic tadpoles, characterized by reduced mouthparts, small oral orifice and large intestinal yolk mass, complete their development in this environment. Molecular data and synapomorphic larval characters support the sister group relationship of the new species to P. macroscelis: both belong to the early diverged lineages in the Philautus tree, whose phylogenetic relationships could not be fully resolved. The new record of endotrophic tadpoles challenges again the hypothesis that terrestrial direct development is the plesiomorphic mode in this genus. Further, we discuss the nature of the frog-plant interaction that could represent a new case of mutualism. The frog provides the plant with a source of nitrogen by depositing yolk-rich eggs in the liquid of the pitcher. The plant, on the other hand, offers an exclusively protected space for the development of tadpoles in a habitat that otherwise has few permanent bodies of water and many competing frog species.",direct development;endotrophy;evolution;mutualism;Nepenthes,JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH,2021,JUL,Article,English,Evolutionary Biology;Zoology

We developed 3 methods of extracting additional ecological detail from acoustic data that are applicable to a broad range of acoustically active species. We conducted landscape-scale passive acoustic surveys of a declining owl species and an invasive congeneric competitor in California. We then used sex-specific vocalization frequency to inform multistate occupancy models; call rates at occupied sites to characterize interactions with interspecific competitors and assess habitat quality; and a flexible multivariate approach to differentiate individuals based on vocal characteristics. The multistate occupancy models yielded novel estimates of breeding status occupancy rates that were more robust to false detections and captured known habitat associations more consistently than single-state occupancy models agnostic to sex. Call rate was related to the presence of a competitor but not habitat quality and thus could constitute a useful behavioral metric for interactions that are challenging to detect in an occupancy framework. Quantifying multivariate distance between groups of vocalizations provided a novel quantitative means of discriminating individuals with >= 20 vocalizations and a flexible tool for balancing type I and II errors. Therefore, it appears possible to estimate site turnover and demographic rates, rather than just occupancy metrics, in PAM programs. Our methods can be applied individually or in concert and are likely generalizable to many acoustically active species. As such, they are opportunities to improve inferences from PAM data and thus benefit conservation.",bioacoustics;call rate;demography;multivariate distance;occupancy modeling;signal theory;vocal individuality,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,2021,FEB,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology;Environmental Sciences

The present study provides the first quantified information on vocal acoustics of calls, sound associated behavioral context, acoustic niche, and vocal activity of this species. We recorded vocal and social behavior of six male-female and six male-male dyads in a standardized social-encounter paradigm in June and July 2016 at the LNP, Nosy Be island. Over six successive nights per dyad, we audio recorded and observed behaviors for 3hr at the beginning of the activity period. Based on the visual inspection of spectrograms and standardized multiparametric sound analysis, we identified seven different call types. Call types can be discriminated based on a combination of harmonicity, fundamental frequency variation, call duration, and degree of tonality. Acoustic features of tonal call types showed that for communication, mouse lemurs use the cryptic, high frequency/ultrasonic frequency niche. Two call types, the Tsak and the Grunt call, were emitted most frequently. Significant differences in vocal activity of the Tsak call were found between male-female and male-male dyads, linked primarily to agonistic conflicts. Dominant mouse lemurs vocalized more than subdominant ones, suggesting that signaling may present an honest indicator of fitness. A comparison of our findings of the Claire's mouse lemur with published findings of five bioacoustically studied mouse lemur species points to the notion that a complex interplay between ecology, predation pressure, and phylogenetic relatedness may shape the evolution of acoustic divergence between species in this smallest-bodied primate radiation. Thus, comparative bioacoustic studies, using standardized procedures, are promising to unravel the role of vocalization for primate species diversity and evolution and for identifying candidates for vocalization-based non-invasive monitoring for conservation purposes.",conservation;evolution;honest signaling;Madagascar;ultrasound;vocalization,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY,2018,JUN,Article,English,Zoology

The use of such indices in complex marine environments, dominated by several anthropogenic and geophonic sources, have yet to be understood fully. In this study, we introduce a noise resilient method based on complexity-entropy (hereafter named C-H) for the detection of biophonic sounds originating from fish choruses. The C-H method was tested on data collected in Changhua and Miaoli (Taiwan) during the spring in both 2016 and 2017. Miaoli was exposed to continual shipping activity, which led to an increase of 10 dB in low frequency ambient noise levels (5-500 Hz). The acoustic dataset was successively analyzed via the acoustic complexity index, the acoustic diversity index and the bioacoustic index. The C-H method was found to be strongly correlated with fish chorusing (Pearson correlation: r(H) < -0.9; r(C) > 0.89), and robust to noise originating from shipping activity or natural sources, such as wind and tides (r(H) and r(C) were between 0.22 and -0.19). Other indices produced lower or null correlations with fish chorusing due to missed identification of the choruses or sensitivity to other sound sources. In contrast to most acoustic indices, the C-H method does not require a prior setting of frequency and amplitude thresholds, and is therefore, more user friendly to untrained technicians. We conclude that the use of the C-H method has potential implications in the efficient detection of fish choruses for management or conservation purposes and could help with overcoming the limitations of acoustic indices in noisy marine environments.",Eastern Taiwan Strait;ecoacoustics;acoustic indices;marine environments;fish choruses;passive acoustic monitoring,ENTROPY,2019,OCT,Article,English,"Physics, Multidisciplinary"

Currently Odorrana graminea is being used as the name of a provisional monotypic species group to include all the populations in China that closely resemble Odorrana livida or O. chloronota. Here, we conducted a range-wide molecular phylogeographic analysis of the large green odorous frog (Odorrana graminea) complex across the majority of its range in China, based on 2780 bp DNA sequences of three mitochondrial genes (12S, 16S, ND2) in 107 samples from 20 sites.

Furthermore, canonical discriminant functions in morphometric analyses showed significant separations of all the paired lineage comparisons in China. The aforementioned genetic divergence and mismatched phenotypes among the lineages within the Odorrana graminea complex, in addition to their non-overlapping geographic distributions, imply extensive lineage diversification.

When two closely related species come into secondary contact, song convergence caused by acquisition of heterospecific songs into the birds' repertoires is often observed. The proximate mechanisms responsible for such mixed singing, and its effect on the speciation process, are poorly understood. We used a combination of genetic and bioacoustic analyses to test whether mixed singing observed in the secondary contact zone of two passerine birds, the Thrush Nightingale (Luscinia luscinia) and the Common Nightingale (L. megarhynchos), is caused by introgressive hybridization. We analysed song recordings of both species from allopatric and sympatric populations together with genotype data from one mitochondrial and seven nuclear loci. Semi-automated comparisons of our recordings with an extensive catalogue of Common Nightingale song types confirmed that most of the analysed sympatric Thrush Nightingale males were `mixed singers' that use heterospecific song types in their repertoires. None of these `mixed singers' possessed any alleles introgressed from the Common Nightingale, suggesting that they were not backcross hybrids. We also analysed songs of five individuals with intermediate phenotype, which were identified as F-1 hybrids between the Thrush Nightingale female and the Common Nightingale male by genetic analysis. Songs of three of these hybrids corresponded to the paternal species (Common Nightingale) but the remaining two sung a mixed song. Our results suggest that although hybridization might increase the tendency for learning songs from both parental species, interspecific cultural transmission is the major proximate mechanism explaining the occurrence of mixed singers among the sympatric Thrush Nightingales. We also provide evidence that mixed singing does not substantially increase the rate of interspecific hybridization and discuss the possible adaptive value of this phenomenon in nightingales.",,PLOS ONE,2013,APR 5,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

The experiments employed adult males of the Chinese species Gampsocleis gratiosa (Decticinae) and the Australian species Mygalopsis marki (Conocephalinae). G. gratiosa emits very broad-band songs with a fundamental frequency component at 3.8 kHz, extremely low for a bushcricket; in contrast, the songs of M. marki have a narrow-band frequency spectrum, from 9 to 25 kHz. Accordingly, the threshold of the auditory organ as a whole is low in the low-frequency range in the case of G. gratiosa, whereas M. marki is similarly sensitive only at frequencies above 5 kHz. The experiments were designed to reveal the origin of this sensitivity difference. One possibility considered was that low-frequency receptors of a particularly sensitive type are present in G. gratiosa and not in M. marki; alternatively, with a similar complement of receptor cells the whole-organ threshold curve might be expanded or restricted as a result of differences in the lower cutoff frequency of the sound-conducting system. The results confirm the latter interpretation. The proximal crista acustica and the distal intermediate organ comprise the same numbers and types of cells in the two species, and the difference in threshold of the low-frequency receptors is produced by a shift of the frequency range in which the acoustic trachea has an amplifying effect.

Tracking changes is necessary for effective resource management. Biological sounds have been suggested as a means to quantify ecosystem health and biodiversity, but this requires an understanding of natural bioacoustic variability and relationships to the taxa present. This investigation sought to characterize spatial and temporal variation in biological sound production within and among reefs that varied in their species assemblages. Multiple acoustic recorders were deployed for intensive 24 h periods and longer-term (similar to 4 mo) duty-cycled deployments on 3 reefs that varied in coral cover and fish density. Short-term results suggest that while there were statistically significant acoustic differences among recorders on a given reef, these differences were relatively small, indicating that a single sensor may be suitable for acoustic characterization of reefs. Analyses of sounds recorded over approximately 4 mo indicated that the strength of diel trends in a low frequency fish band (100 to 1000 Hz) was correlated with coral cover and fish density but the strength of high-frequency snapping shrimp (2 to 20 kHz) trends was not, suggesting that low-frequency recordings may be better indicators of the species assemblages present. Power spectra varied within reefs over the deployment periods, underscoring the need for long-duration recordings to characterize these trends.

However, just as the scope of geometry transcends comparative anatomy, the potential scope of morphometric analysis transcends investigations of the form and shape of organismal bodies. An important area of opportunity for morphometricians lies in the application of geometric methods to non-traditional form/shape analysis problems. To illustrate the potential of morphometric data analysis approaches to contribute to investigations outside its traditional base in (physical) morphology we report here results of an investigation into the morphometrics of bat echolocation calls. By treating Hanning windowed spectrograms of bat search echolocation calls as complex 3D surfaces, and by using a variant of eigensurface analysis to sample and compare these surfaces, it is possible to identify bat species to very high levels of accuracy (> 90\% for raw cross-validated training set identifications, > 80\% for jackknifed training set identifications), even for species (e.g., Myotis) whose spectrograms have resisted separation into species-specific clusters using-traditional spectrogram descriptors. Moreover, the shape modeling capabilities of geometric morphometrics render the complex mathematical subspaces within which these spectrogram shape data reside - along with the discriminant functions used to separate training-set clusters - interpretable in a simple, intuitive, and biologically informative manner. These results demonstrate the rich source of species-specific information bioacoustic signal structures represent. They also illustrate the type of advances that can be made when morphometricians venture beyond the traditional confines of their field to address wider questions of significance in the biological and the-physical sciences.",morphometrics;bats;echolocation;systematics;acoustics;geometry;shape analysis,HYSTRIX-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY,2013,,Article,English,Zoology

Reversing declines requires a good understanding of habitat quality. Local studies have shown that territory settlement date (arrival) is generally correlated with density and productivity. Despite widespread acceptance, large-scale multispecies demonstrations of arrival time being correlated with habitat quality are lacking. We investigated whether arrival date estimated from ecozonal scale bioacoustic monitoring could be predicted by an independent estimate of estimated density for Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), Tennessee Warbler (Leiothlypis peregrina), and Yellow-rumped Warbler (Setophaga coronata). We also examined local Ovenbird settlement patterns by comparing relative arrival and observed local density differences between nearby territories. Arrival date was estimated as the first focal species detection date on a breeding territory and the cure4insect R package was used to predict estimated average density. Using predicted average density as a habitat quality proxy, we found earlier arrivals in higher quality territories (Ovenbird 1.04 +/-0.33 days earlier, Tennessee Warbler 1.96 +/-0.36 days earlier, Yellow-rumped Warbler 1.23 +/-0.54 days earlier). We also showed that arrival time was earlier in habitats preferred by each species. Spatial patterns of arrival varied among species although latitude was always an important predictor. Locations where predicted Ovenbird densities were estimated to be higher were filled before sites with lower predicted density but only 600 m away (2.9 +/-1.4 days earlier). Correlating migrant arrival time and density suggests density is a reasonable measure of habitat quality. Combined, density and arrival data from bioacoustics provide a low-cost habitat-assessment tool that better informs the types of forest that need to be protected for species of concern, which will be particularly important as land-use and climate change impacts increase in the boreal forest.",arrival;bioacoustics;density;habitat quality;migration,AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY,2022,AUG,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology;Ornithology

There is a great need for increased use and further development of automated animal sound recording and identification to improve monitoring efficiency and accuracy for the benefit of conservation. Greece, with its high number of endemic species, represents a hotspot for European Biodiversity, including Orthopteran insects. Songs of many Orthoptera might be employed for the inventorying and monitoring of individual species and communities. We assessed the regional spatio-temporal composition of Orthoptera species at the Hymettos near Athens, which is a Natura 2000 site under constant threat due to the surrounding megacity. Within the framework of the EU Life Plus funded AmiBio project, we documented the Orthopteran species' habitat characteristics, their co-occurrence and phenology. We found, in total, 20 species with seven to ten Orthoptera at locations characterised by diverse vegetation patterns of perennial herbs and bushes. For the purposes of implementation of an automated remote monitoring scheme, we identified sampling sites with high Orthopteran diversity, allowing the monitoring of all singing Orthoptera within single localities. By analysing sound depositories and adding recordings from new sample individuals, we established a song library as prerequisites for future automatic song detection. Based on our results, acoustic recording units have been placed at remote sites at the Hymettos. We discuss recommendations for further studies to fully employ the potential of automated acoustic monitoring of Orthoptera. A reliable assessment of singing Orthoptera needs recording units covering ultrasound. Due to high attenuation and absorbance by the vegetation, particularly of the high frequencies characterising Orthopteran songs, positioning of microphones at sites is critical: the microphone sensor network has to be an order of magnitude denser than for monitoring birds.",Biodiversity monitoring;Wildlife recording;Autonomous monitoring;Sound;Orthoptera,JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION,2014,OCT,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Entomology

The frog Allobates femoralis has been regarded as a pan-Amazonian species, and widely used as a model for addressing evolutionary issues regarding patterns of intraspecific diversification, social organisation, and animal communication. Recent accumulation of genetic, morphological, and bioacoustic data gathered from different localities strongly supports the idea that it represents a species complex, but field behavioural observations related to courtship and mating are surprisingly scarce. Here, we provide a description of several aspects of the reproductive biology of A. femoralis from a Central Amazon site, and compare our results with the few published reports for the species. This study demonstrated that, besides the known divergence in the number of notes of the A. femoralis call, there are both quantitative and qualitative differences regarding reproductive traits between two populations of this taxon. The most striking difference was the observation of cephalic amplexus in the population from the Reserva Ducke, Brazil, which contrasts with the absence of any kind of body contact between A. femoralis pairs during mating interactions at the Panguana Biological Station, Peru. In addition, we report for the first time a set of visual components of the courtship behaviour, such as throat display, limb lifting, circling, and leg stretching. Behavioural differences can lead to a pre-zygotic isolation, thus representing a first step in the speciation process through differential sexual preferences. Hence, our finding of divergence in a set of traits probably related to mate recognition and choice is surprising within populations assigned to a single clade, and highlights the importance of considering behavioural traits in order to disentangle the evolutionary forces driving the diversification of A. femoralis.",Anura;communication;Dendrobatoidea;divergence;pre-zygotic traits,ETHOLOGY ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION,2011,,Article,English,Behavioral Sciences;Zoology

The Barusan Shama Copsychus (malabaricus) melanurus, a highly-prized songster from the West Sumatran Archipelago,is one of the most threatened taxa in Asia's songbird trade crisis, yet its predicament is often overlooked because some taxonomists treat it as a mere subspecies of the widespread White-rumped Shama C. malabaricus. Here, we provide the first modern comprehensive assessment of the on-the-ground status of Barusan Shamas across all major islands of the West Sumatran Archipelago based on visual and bioacoustic surveys, mist-netting activity, as well as community interviews covering approximately the last five years. A lack of ornithological field records across many years as well as documented drops in local capture rates indicate that increasing poaching pressure and market value have likely driven the Barusan Shama to extinction in the wild on all islands except Siberut. Even on Siberut, we document a drastic population crash and estimate impending extinction in the wild within perhaps five years in the absence of considerable changes in human behaviour. The decline and presumed extermination of some Barusan Shama island populations was so precipitous that it became evident even within our five-year monitoring period. Although our field efforts and those of others must continue, this bird's future now likely hinges on ex situ conservation efforts. The Barusan Shama occurs in four described subspecies, each endemic to its own island group, further complicating conservation efforts. Although the nominate subspecies melanurus remains relatively common in captivity on Nias and Mentawai, the other three subspecies are currently known from captive populations of a magnitude of about 100 for hypolizus, a handful for opisthochrus and zero for mirabilis, casting doubt on whether ex situ efforts can be initiated fast enough to assure the survival of individual subspecies.",,FORKTAIL,2019,,Article,English,Ornithology

It contains a large number of morphologically cryptic species that are being discovered with the assistance of genetic evidence. We use molecular, morphological, bioacoustic, and environmental data to assess the phylogenetic relationships and determine the species within an Andean Glade of Pristimantis, which is distributed from central Ecuador to northern Peru. We assign to this Glade the name Huicundomantis and propose it as a subgenus. Our results show that Huicundomantis is composed of two large clades which we name as the P. phoxocephalus species group and the P. cryptomelas species group. Huicundomantis is composed of 28 species of which 12 have been described and 16 are new. We describe 11 of these undescribed species. The most effective characters to discriminate among species are DNA sequences, qualitative morphology, and advertisement calls. Morphometric and environmental characters are not very useful to define species limits. We clarify the identity of P. riveti and show that populations from southern Ecuador traditionally ascribed to P. riveti are a new species, P. lutzae sp. nov. We also show that P. prometeii is a junior synonym of P. harapatusami. The current diversity and geographic distribution of Huicundomantis are consistent with a model of allopatric speciation. All species have a restricted distribution range (less than 4330 km(2)) and are assigned to the Red List categories Data Deficient or threatened with extinction. We provide new reasons to increase conservation efforts for these species and their habitat.

The difficilis holotype is not conspecific with other specimens hitherto named Boophis difficilis but belongs to the B. tephraeomystax group based on lack of webbing between fingers and the presence of heterogeneously granular ventral skin. Rhacophorus difficilis Boettger, 1892 is considered as junior synonym of Boophis tephracomystax. The Boophis difficilis group is dissolved and its species are transferred to a new species group named after Boophis majori, the oldest of the included taxa. All species of the B. majori group, their type specimens, and their geographical distributions are revised based on new morphological, bioacoustic and ecological data. Five new species of the group from the eastern rainforests of Madagascar are described. Morphological differentiation within the B. majori group is low, although some species can be distinguished by characters such as snout-vent length, relative tympanum size, or coloration. The most reliable character for species identification are advertisement calls which are strikingly different between most species of the group. Species diversity in Boophis is highest in central eastern Madagascar and gets lower at the northern and southern borders of the island. Available data do not allow a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the B. majori group, but a northern subgroup of small species without red coloration and a southern subgroup of larger species with distinct red pigments can be distinguished. Osteological data for B. miniatus are provided. Within Boophis, representatives of all species groups except the B. tephraeomystax group are characterized by a synapomorphic reduction of the anterolateral hyoidal process.

Based on the above multiple lines of evidence, we describe the population of the Dabie Mountains as a new species, Microhyla dabieshanensis sp. nov. This study enriches the diversity of Microhylidae, and clarifies the species of the genus Microhyla in the Dabie Mountains. Microhyla dabieshanensis sp. nov. is distributed in the Dabie Mountains above 500 m above sea level, and in some areas has sympatric distribution with M. fissipes and M. heymonsi. Species belonging to the genus Microhyla are small-sized frogs that are widely distributed in southern, eastern, and south-eastern Asia. In China, the genus harbors many cryptic species, on two of which-M. beilunensis and M. fanjinshanensis-studies were recently published. In this study, we collected specimens from the Dabie Mountain range, which is at the junction of Anhui, Henan and Hubei Provinces, East China; these specimens belonged to a species previously identified as M. mixtura. Based on phylogenetic analyses, species delimitation analyses, morphological comparisons and advertisement calls comparisons, we found they were significantly different from other known congeners, and thus we describe them as a new species.

FE noise is attributed to a broadband part and narrowband components-forced expiratory wheezes (FEWs). FE respiratory noise is composed by acoustic and hydrodynamic mechanisms. An origin of the most powerful mid-frequency FEWs (400-600Hz) is associated with the 0th-3rd levels of bronchial tree in terms of Weibel {[}(2009). Swiss Med. Wkly. 139(27-28), 375-386], whereas high-frequency FEWs (above 600Hz) are attributed to the 2nd-6th levels of bronchial tree.

An analysis of signals by the new method, including FE time in the range from 200 to 2000Hz and band-pass durations and energies in the 200-Hz bands evaluation, is applied instead of FEWs direct measures. It is demonstrated experimentally that developed FE acoustic parameters correspond to basic indices of lung function evaluated by spirometry and body plethysmography and may be even more sensitive to some respiratory deviations. According to preliminary experimental results, the developed technique may be considered as a promising instrument for acoustic monitoring human lung function in extreme conditions, including diving and space flights. The developed technique eliminates the contact of the sensor with the human oral cavity, which is characteristic for spirometry and body plethysmography.

Molecular phylogenetic results corroborate the recently suggested splittings of the two former taxa into three and two species, respectively. By contrast to previous opinion, differentiation of territorial songs parallels the genetic diversification in both groups. In the P. reguloides group, all recently established species can be distinguished by a characteristic song pattern. Regularly structured songs composed of repeated two- or three-note syllables were found in all species of the group, whereas trill songs with single notes repeated are unique to Phylloscopus claudiae. The phylogenetic relationships of Phylloscopus occipitalis are ambiguous among different molecular trees, but song pattern clearly corroborates a close relationship to the P. reguloides group. In the white-tailed leaf warbler group, songs are irregularly structured and often descending in frequency with exception of P. davisoni and Phylloscopus ogilviegranti disturbans. Song pattern corroborates the genetic affiliation of Phylloscopus hainanus and Phylloscopus xanthoschistos to the molecular white-tailed leaf warbler clade. All target species correspond to distinct acoustic clusters resulting from discriminant analysis of several spectral and structural song parameters. Linear correlation between genetic and acoustic differentiation (pairwise p-distances versus difference of discriminant functions) is significant within both groups, except for one case, in which discriminant function 1 was correlated with a spectral parameter (minimum frequency) only.

Freshwater systems are globally threatened and in need of enhanced monitoring and assessment. We applied soundscape recording and analysis-which presents an opportunity for long-term, high-resolution animal community monitoring and assessment-to a freshwater context to better understand the acoustic diversity and dynamics of these systems. 2. We recorded the aquatic soundscape of a Neotropical freshwater swamp in Costa Rica for 23 days in January and February 2015 during the dry season. We classified biological sound types in these recordings and developed measurements of richness and occupancy based on this classification. We also calculated six complementary acoustic indices to assess soundscape diversity and daily and longer-term soundscape dynamics, and we examined correlations between these acoustic indices and sound type metrics. 3. We found rich soundscapes in which biological sounds were almost always present, and we classified 18 sound types that we attribute to aquatic insects. These sound types showed distinct daily patterns and exhibited temporal and spectral acoustic niche partitioning. Sound type richness was most correlated with the number of peaks index (correlation = .36; p < .001), while sound type occupancy was most correlated with the Bioacoustic Index (correlation = .92; p < .001). In contrast to generally high levels of acoustic activity, there were brief (approximately 1 hr), unexpected quiet periods around dawn and dusk. 4. This study represents an early attempt to comprehensively describe tropical freshwater soundscapes in a systematic and quantitative manner. We demonstrate that sound type classification and the quantification of acoustic occupancy capture aspects of soundscape diversity and dynamics that are complementary to those assessed by acoustic indices.

However, the accuracy of the results depends on the bioacoustic characteristics of the focal taxa and their habitat use. In particular, this applies to bats which exhibit distinct activity patterns in three-dimensionally structured habitats such as forests. We assessed the performance of 21 acoustic sampling schemes with three temporal sampling patterns and seven sampling designs. Acoustic sampling was performed in 32 forest plots, each containing three microhabitats: forest ground, canopy, and forest gap. We compared bat activity, species richness, and sampling effort using species accumulation curves fitted with the clench equation. In addition, we estimated the sampling costs to undertake the best sampling schemes. We recorded a total of 145,433 echolocation call sequences of 16 bat species. Our results indicated that to generate the best outcome, it was necessary to sample all three microhabitats of a given forest location simultaneously throughout the entire night. Sampling only the forest gaps and the forest ground simultaneously was the second best choice and proved to be a viable alternative when the number of available detectors is limited. When assessing bat species richness at the 1-km(2) scale, the implementation of these sampling schemes at three to four forest locations yielded highest labor cost-benefit ratios but increasing equipment costs. Our study illustrates that multiple passive acoustic sampling schemes require testing based on the target taxa and habitat complexity and should be performed with reference to cost-benefit ratios. Choosing a standardized and replicated sampling scheme is particularly important to optimize the level of precision in inventories, especially when rare or elusive species are expected.",Activity;cost-effectiveness;echolocation;forest microhabitats;inventory;species richness,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2014,DEC,Article,English,Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

Currently, quantitative and statistical definition is lacking for the vocalisations of many dasyurids, an important group of small to medium-sized marsupials from Australasia that includes the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus), a species of conservation concern. Beyond generating a better understanding of this species' social interactions, determining an acoustic repertoire will further improve detection rates and inference of vocalisations gathered by automated bioacoustic recorders. Hence, this study investigated eastern quoll vocalisations using objective signal processing techniques to quantitatively analyse spectrograms recorded from 15 different individuals. Recordings were collected in conjunction with observations of the behaviours associated with each vocalisation to develop an acoustic-based behavioural repertoire for the species. Analysis of recordings produced a putative classification of five vocalisation types: Bark, Growl, Hiss, Cp-cp, and Chuck. These were most frequently observed during agonistic encounters between conspecifics, most likely as a graded sequence from Hisses occurring in a warning context through to Growls and finally Barks being given prior to, or during, physical confrontations between individuals. Quantitative and statistical methods were used to objectively establish the accuracy of these five putative call types. A multinomial logistic regression indicated a 97.27\% correlation with the perceptual classification, demonstrating support for the five different vocalisation types. This putative classification was further supported by hierarchical cluster analysis and silhouette information that determined the optimal number of clusters to be five. Minor disparity between the objective and perceptual classifications was potentially the result of gradation between vocalisations, or subtle differences present within vocalisations not discernible to the human ear. The implication of these different vocalisations and their given context is discussed in relation to the ecology of the species and the potential application of passive acoustic monitoring techniques.",,PLOS ONE,2017,JUL 7,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

Consequently, the complexity of the classification function increases proportionally with the number of species. To avoid this issue, we propose a hierarchical approach that decomposes the problem into three taxonomic levels: the family, the genus, and the species. To accomplish this, we transform the original single-labelled problem into a multi-output problem (multi-label and multi-class) considering the biological taxonomy of the species. We then develop a top-down method using a set of classifiers organized as a hierarchical tree. We test and compare two hierarchical methods, using (1) one classifier per parent node and (2) one classifier per level, against a flat approach. Thus, we conclude that it is possible to predict the same set of species as a flat classifier, and additionally obtain new information about the samples and their taxonomic relationship. This helps us to better understand the problem and achieve additional conclusions by the inspection of the confusion matrices at the three classification levels. In addition, we propose a soft decision rule based on the joint probabilities of hierarchy pathways. With this we are able to identify and reject confusing cases. We carry out our experiments using cross-validation performed by individuals. This form of CV avoids mixing syllables that belong to the same specimens in the testing and training sets, preventing an overestimate of the accuracy and generalizing the predictive capabilities of the system. We tested our methods in a dataset with sixty individual frogs, from ten different species, eight genera, and four families, achieving a final Macro-Fscore of 80 and 70\% with and without applying the rejection rule, respectively.",Hierarchical multi-label classification;Multi-output classification;LCPN;LCPL;Anurans taxonomy;Anuran calls recognition,MACHINE LEARNING,2018,NOV,Article,English,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence"
10.1111/2041-210X.12223,Large-scale analysis of frequency modulation in birdsong data bases,"Stowell,Dan;Plumbley,MarkD.",University of London;Queen Mary University London,"Birdsong often contains large amounts of rapid frequency modulation (FM). It is believed that the use or otherwise of FM is adaptive to the acoustic environment and also that there are specific social uses of FM such as trills in aggressive territorial encounters. Yet temporal fine detail of FM is often absent or obscured in standard audio signal analysis methods such as Fourier analysis or linear prediction. Hence, it is important to consider high-resolution signal processing techniques for analysis of FM in bird vocalizations. If such methods can be applied at big data scales, this offers a further advantage as large data sets become available. We introduce methods from the signal processing literature which can go beyond spectrogram representations to analyse the fine modulations present in a signal at very short time-scales. Focusing primarily on the genus Phylloscopus, we investigate which of a set of four analysis methods most strongly captures the species signal encoded in birdsong. We evaluate this through a feature selection technique and an automatic classification experiment. In order to find tools useful in practical analysis of large data bases, we also study the computational time taken by the methods, and their robustness to additive noise and MP3 compression. We find three methods which can robustly represent species-correlated FM attributes and can be applied to large data sets, and that the simplest method tested also appears to perform the best. We find that features representing the extremes of FM encode species identity supplementary to that captured in frequency features, whereas bandwidth features do not encode additional information. FM analysis can extract information useful for bioacoustic studies, in addition to measures more commonly used to characterize vocalizations. Further, it can be applied efficiently across very large data sets and archives.",audio;big data;bioacoustics;chirplet;FM;vocalization,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2014,SEP,Article,English,Ecology

,African parrot vocalizations and their functional significance,"Venuto,V;Massa,R;Bottoni,L",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Parrot vocalisation is a very complex bioacoustic subject even to those biologists who are familiar with songbird analysis. This appears to be related to the great semantic complexity of vocal communication of these birds. Therefore,the detailed description of vocalisations appears to be crucial for future analysis of Parrot communication. Since 1993, we started to investigate different aspects of both learned and innate vocalisations of African Poicephalus Parrots. In this paper, we review these studies to summarise the following findings potentially useful to the study of Parrot communication: (i) Duets: in the Red-fronted Parrot Poicephalus gulielmi, the complexity of the duet is a function of the stability of the pair bond; the song convergence increases with the length of time that the pair has previously spent together and duet complexity is learned and refined over time; (ii) Identification motif we studied the nest interactions between parents and chicks in Meyer's Parrot (Poicephalus meyeri). We found that identification motifs are developed which are peculiar to an individual and function as a way of identifying the individual to its family group; (iii) Food begging call: we describe the ontogeny and possible fate of food begging calls in 5 species of Poicephalus Parrots. This call has a pulsing structure and the number of pulses is reduced with time. The final outcome of the develop-mental process from the innate food begging call seems to be the learned contact call of adults; (iv) Distress call: the distress call of African Poicephalus Parrots is a sexually dimorphic vocalisation, with significant differences in the main physical parameters of the two sexes of all the species studied. We also found significant differences between species and superspecies even though this vocalisation is extremely conservative.",,OSTRICH,2001,JUL,Article; Proceedings Paper,English,Ornithology

Successful conservation of anurans will rely on improved data on the status and changes in local populations, particularly for rare and threatened species. Automated sensors, such as acoustic recorders, have the potential to provide such data by massively increasing the spatial and temporal scale of population sampling efforts. Analyzing such data sets will require robust and efficient tools that can automatically identify the presence of a species in audio recordings. Like bats and birds, many anuran species produce distinct vocalizations that can be captured by autonomous acoustic recorders and represent excellent candidates for automated recognition. However, in contrast to birds and bats, effective automated acoustic recognition tools for anurans are not yet widely available. An effective automated call-recognition method for anurans must be robust to the challenges of real-world field data and should not require extensive labeled data sets. We devised a vocalization identification tool that classifies anuran vocalizations in audio recordings based on their periodic structure: the repeat interval-based bioacoustic identification tool (RIBBIT). We applied RIBBIT to field recordings to study the boreal chorus frog (Pseudacris maculata) of temperate North American grasslands and the critically endangered variable harlequin frog (Atelopus varius) of tropical Central American rainforests. The tool accurately identified boreal chorus frogs, even when they vocalized in heavily overlapping choruses and identified variable harlequin frog vocalizations at a field site where it had been very rarely encountered in visual surveys. Using a few simple parameters, RIBBIT can detect any vocalization with a periodic structure, including those of many anurans, insects, birds, and mammals. We provide open-source implementations of RIBBIT in Python and R to support its use for other taxa and communities.",acoustic;amphibian;classification;detection;endangered;machine learning;monitoring;signal processing;ac\&\#250;stico;anfibio;aprendizaje mec\&\#225;nico;clasificaci\&\#243;n;detecci\&\#243;n;en peligro;monitoreo;procesamiento de se\&\#241;al,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,2021,OCT,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology;Environmental Sciences

Their homogeneous external morphology and continental geographic distribution in South America have posed severe limitations to a comprehensive review, such that taxonomic consensus and species limits remain uncertain. This is further worsened by the presence of chromatic polymorphism among coexisting species that can hardly be distinguished by external morphology. Based on a large-scale geographic sampling including multilocus DNA analyses, and acoustic and morphological data, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the taxonomic status and species limits of the L. latrans group, focusing on the resolution of the L. latrans complex and the species pair L. chaquensis-L. macrosternum. We gathered 728 mitochondrial sequences from 429 localities, encompassing the entire geographic distribution of the group. Both generalized mixed Yule coalescent and automatic barcode gap discovery species delimitation methods recovered four major mitochondrial evolutionary lineages within the L. latrans complex, also supported by distribution patterns, multilocus molecular, morphological and/or bioacoustic data. One lineage is linked to nominal L. latrans, one revalidated as Leptodactylus luctator, and the other two are formally named and described. Another lineage encompasses all specimens previously assigned to the species pair L. chaquensis-L. macrosternum, clustered as a single evolutionary entity and is now regarded as L. macrosternum. We provide a revised diagnosis for these species based on acoustic data, morphological/chromatic variation, and phylogenetic relationships of all species currently included in the L. latrans group. Our findings reinforce the view that Neotropical diversity is highly underestimated and stress that appropriate geographic sampling in an integrative framework is crucial for the establishment of specific limits among broadly distributed and morphologically cryptic Neotropical frogs.",Bioacoustics;Cryptic species;Geographic distribution;Mitochondrial species delimitation;Molecular systematics;Morphology;Morphometrics,HERPETOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,2020,DEC,Review,English,Zoology

Recently, passive acoustic monitoring has emerged as a useful wildlife monitoring tool and automatic recorders have been used to detect the presence of gibbons in protected areas of Vietnam. However, these recording devices can be expensive, cumbersome, and difficult to operate in some areas with gibbons. Therefore, inexpensive, lightweight, and easily operated recording devices are needed for wildlife monitoring. In this study, we employed mobile smartphones to detect the presence and distribution, and to estimate the occurrence probability, of the northern yellow-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus annamensis) in Dakrong Nature Reserve (405.3 km(2)), Vietnam. We surveyed gibbons from February to July 2019, during the dry season, at 95 sites that were systematically spaced throughout the nature reserve. We used the software package, RAVEN, to analyze the sound data and to identify gibbon calls. We detected gibbon calls at 39 out of 95 recording sites. With these data and an occupancy model, we estimated, and examined the effects of environmental factors, on the occurrence probability. Assuming a 600 m detection distance, the model-averaged occurrence probability for the nature reserve was 0.44 (SE = 0.06). The area of rich (> 100 m(3)/ha) and medium (> 200 m(3)/ha) evergreen forest within 1 km of the recording posts was the most important predictor of, and positively correlated with, occurrence with less occurrence in poor, regrowth forest, plantations, or on bare land. Bioacoustic methods can be potentially used in large-scale gibbon surveys, and the technology is especially attractive given the low cost. Additional work on estimating detection distances and identifying individual gibbon groups using bioacoustics will be useful next steps.",Bioacoustics;Dakrong;Gibbon;Nomascus;Occupancy model;Primate;Smartphone,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,2021,MAR,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology;Environmental Sciences
10.1002/rse2.141,Source separation in ecoacoustics: A roadmap towards versatile soundscape information retrieval,"Lin,Tzu-Hao;Tsao,Yu",Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science \& Technology (JAMSTEC);Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"A comprehensive assessment of ecosystem dynamics requires the monitoring of biological, physical and social changes. Changes that cannot be observed visually may be trackable acoustically through soundscape analysis. Soundscapes vary greatly depending on geophysical events, biodiversity and human activities. However, retrieving source-specific information from geophony, biophony and anthropophony remains a challenging task, due to interference by simultaneous sound sources. Audio source separation is a technique that aims to recover individual sound sources when only mixtures are accessible. Here, we review techniques of monoaural audio source separation with the fundamental theories and assumptions behind them. Depending on the availability of prior information about the source signals, the task can be approached as a blind source separation or a model-based source separation. Most blind source separation techniques depend on assumptions about the behaviour of the source signals, and their performance may deteriorate when the assumptions fail. Model-based techniques generally do not require specific assumptions, and the models are directly learned from labelled data. With the recent advances of deep learning, the model-based techniques can yield state-of-the-art separation performance, accordingly facilitate content-based audio information retrieval. Source separation techniques have been adopted in several ecoacoustic applications to evaluate the contributions from biodiversity and anthropogenic disturbance to soundscape dynamics. They can also be employed as nonlinear filters to improve the recognition of bioacoustic signals. To effectively retrieve ecological information from soundscapes, source separation is a crucial tool. We believe that the future integrations of ecological hypotheses and deep learning can realize a high-performance source separation for ecoacoustics, and accordingly improve soundscape-based ecosystem monitoring. Therefore, we outline a roadmap for applying source separation to assist in soundscape information retrieval and hope to promote cross-disciplinary collaboration.",acoustic habitat;biodiversity;ecosystem dynamics;machine learning;passive acoustics;signal processing,REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,2020,SEP,Review,English,Ecology;Remote Sensing

In the tropics, it is possible to find more than 60 bat species at a single site. However, monitoring bats is challenging due to their small size, ability to fly, cryptic nature, and nocturnal activity. Recently, bioacoustic techniques have been incorporated into survey methods, either through passive acoustic monitoring or acoustic bat lures. Lures have been developed on the premise that broadcasting acoustic stimuli increases the number of captures in harp traps or mist nets. However, this is a relatively new, niche method. This study tested the efficacy of two commonly used acoustic bat lure devices, broadcasting two different acoustic stimuli, to increase forest understory bat captures in the tropics. This is the first time an acoustic bat lure has been systematically tested in a tropical rainforest, and the first study to compare two lure devices (Sussex AutoBat and Apodemus BatLure). Using a paired experimental design, two synthesized acoustic stimuli were broadcasted, a feeding call and a social call, to understand the importance of the call type used on capture rates and genus-specific responses. Using an acoustic lure significantly increased capture rates, while the type of device did not impact capture rates. The two acoustic stimuli had an almost even distribution of captures, suggesting that the type of call may be less important than previously thought. Results indicate a possible deterrent effect on Rhinolophous sp., while being particularly effective for attracting bats in the genera Murina and Kerivoula. This study highlights the effectiveness of lures, however, also indicates that lure effects can vary across genera. Therefore, lures may bias survey results by altering the species composition of bats caught. Future research should focus on a single species or genus, using synthesized calls of conspecifics, to fully understand the effect of lures.",acoustic lure;bats;bioacoustics;Borneo;capture techniques;Chiroptera;echolocation;monitoring techniques,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2022,APR,Article,English,Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

We observed a high biomass of zooplankton between 53.8degrees and 53.4degreesS associated with the inshore, northwestward flow of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF) that occurred in around 2500 m of water close to the base of the slope. There was very little zooplankton biomass present in the more offshore, eastward flowing waters where a second manifestation of the SACCF was also present on the section. The region of enhanced zooplankton biomass was over 50 km in horizontal extent with the highest densities (>10 g m(-3)) in the area of strongest flow (>35 cm s(-1)). The majority of the zooplankton present on the section was Antarctic krill and most of it occurred in the upper 100 m. The rate of physically mediated transport of Antarctic krill across the off-shelf sections (similar to10 km) of the transect showed marked variation, with highest rates (>10(6) g s(-1)) associated with the northwestward flow of the SACCF. Farther offshore, where the krill biomass and flow rates were much reduced, the flux of krill was very low. The integrated horizontal flux of krill across the offshore sections was large (192 x 10(3) t d(-1)) and to the northwest. A second occupation of the transect showed that the krill flux is highly variable, and we discuss the various physical and biological factors that will generate such variability. We show that horizontal flux of krill in ocean currents is a major factor in determining the abundance of krill around South Georgia.",Southern Ocean;krill;circulation;ecosystem;South Georgia;food web,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS,2004,JAN 31,Article,English,Oceanography

However, the large amounts of audio that can be easily and efficiently collected necessitates automated methods of analysis to extract useful ecological data. Acoustic indices have been used in spectrographic visualisation of long environmental recordings to successfully identify many biological sounds from their acoustic patterns and features. In particular, the choruses of several frog species are conspicuous in these spectrogram images which suggests that acoustic indices may be useful for detecting species in automated sound classification algorithms. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of acoustic indices as predictors in classification models for automated identification of frog species in environmental sound recordings from breeding habitats in north Queensland, Australia. Three types of classification models (random forests, support vector machines and gradient boosting) were trained and validated on a data set of 3274 1-minute audio segments labelled for the presence or absence of calling of 12 target frog species, and a feature set of 11 acoustic indices calculated on frequency bins of bandwidth 43.1 Hz. Classification performance was high for all 12 target species on the validation data set held out from the labelled training data (precision range 0.90-1.00 and recall range 0.83-0.99). However, performance declined for most target species when predicting frog calling on a further test data set taken from unseen recordings from the same sites. Best prediction results on the test data were achieved for species with the most training data, indicating accuracy may be improved by increasing training data, and this method is best suited to predicting chorusing of common species.",Acoustic indices;Acoustic monitoring;Automated species detection;Bioacoustics;Anurans;Frog chorusing,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2020,DEC,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Environmental Sciences

Stumpffia are terrestrial frogs with a largely unknown biology, probably due to their small size and secretive habits. Previous studies have suggested a large proportion of undescribed diversity in the genus. We revise the genus on the basis of a combination of molecular, bioacoustic, and morphological data and describe 26 new species that are all genetically divergent, almost all of them with high pairwise genetic divergences > 4\% p-distance in a segment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene and concordant differentiation in a segment of the nuclear Rag-1 gene. The majority of the new species can also be distinguished by the structure of their advertisement calls (where bioacoustic data are available), and in most comparisons the species can also be distinguished morphologically. Furthermore, a molecular phylogeny reconstructed from DNA sequences of one nuclear and four mitochondrial gene segments revealed that in many cases, morphologically similar species are not each other's closest relatives, thus confirming their identity as independent evolutionary lineages and revealing repeated phenotypic divergence and convergence among and within clades. The phylogeny distinguishes four main clades in the genus: Clade A containing 17 species (Stumpffia be, S. hara, S. megsoni, S. staffordi, S. psologlossa, S. analamaina, S. gimmeli, S. madagascariensis, S. pygmaea, S. angeluci sp. nov., S. huwei sp. nov., S. iharana sp. nov., S. larinki sp. nov., S. maledicta sp. nov., S. mamitika sp. nov., S. sorata sp. nov., and S. yanniki sp. nov.) mostly from northern and northwestern Madagascar, generally characterized by limited digital reduction and divided in subclades of comparatively large, small, and miniaturized body size, respectively; Clade B with four species (S. miery, S. meikeae sp. nov., S. obscoena sp. nov., and S. davidattenboroughi sp. nov.) morphologically ranging from miniaturized with strong digital reduction to comparatively large-sized; Clade C with 18 species (S. grandis, S. kibomena, S. roseifemoralis, S. tetradactyla, S. nigrorubra sp. nov., S. achillei sp. nov., S. diutissima sp. nov., S. pardus sp. nov., S. edmondsi sp. nov., S. fusca sp. nov., S. jeannoeli sp. nov., S. spandei sp. nov., S. garraffoi sp. nov., S. analanjirofo sp. nov., S. miovaova sp. nov., S. makira sp. nov., S. betampona sp. nov., and S. dolchi sp. nov.) mostly distributed in eastern and northeastern Madagascar, containing species of comparatively large size as well as small-sized species, many of which are characterized by a moderate degree of digital reduction; and Clade D with two miniaturized species (S. tridactyla and S. contumelia sp. nov.) with strong digital reduction, which form the sister group of all other Stumpffia. Two of the newly described species (S. angeluci and S. maledicta) are not separated by the 4\% threshold in the 16S gene but occur in sympatry and do not share Rag-1 haplotypes. To achieve a comprehensive review of this species-rich genus, we provide simplified differential diagnoses and descriptions and abbreviated descriptions of morphological variation. Despite the large number of Stumpffia species newly described herein, we identify several additional candidate species with currently insufficient data to warrant formal description, and highlight that some species such as S. analanjirofo, S. gimmeli, S. kibomena, S. madagascariensis, S. roseifemoralis and S. obscoena are composed of two or more deep mitochondrial lineages that might also turn out to be distinct taxa after in-depth study. We confirm Stumpffia as a genus of highly microendemic frogs with many species apparently restricted to very small ranges, and provide evidence that two of the new species (S. achillei and S. davidattenboroughi) do not construct foam nests but lay their eggs in wet places in the leaf litter, or in cavities such as empty snail shells. We propose a conservation status for all the described species according to IUCN Red List Criteria, but also discuss several problems applying these criteria to such microendemic and poorly known frogs.",Amphibia;Anura;Microhylidae;diversity;systematics;bioacoustics;molecular genetics;morphology;microendemism,VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY,2017,,Article,English,Zoology

We describe the vocal behavior of Great Curassows (Crax rubra), a little-studied Cracid species currently listed as vulnerable. From 2008 to 2010, we recorded curassows in northwest Costa Rica using both handheld and automated digital recorders. Analysis of recordings revealed that Great Curassows had a vocal repertoire of five call types. Yip and bark calls are sex-specific alarm calls of short duration (0.12 and 0.08 s, respectively). The descending whistle is a longer duration alarm call (2.18 s) produced primarily by males. The snarl is a short call (0.67 s) associated with a threat display produced by adults with dependent young. The boom call was the most common Great Curassow vocalization, and was given only by males. Boom calls are long (8.86 s), low-frequency (< 150 Hz), multisyllable calls comprised of four stereotyped phrases. Great Curassows often uttered boom calls well before dawn, with a peak in activity at dawn and the hours following. Males produced bouts of repeated boom calls that lasted an average of 35 min, but sometimes continued for more than 5 h. Boom calls were given from February to June, with a peak in late April and early May when breeding begins. Discriminant analysis of boom calls of birds from 10 different locations revealed interindividual variation in call structure that may be useful for bioacoustic monitoring of individuals. Our results suggest that automated recorders might provide a way to monitor the abundance of male curassows because their boom calls are given frequently during the period from February to June and can be detected at distances up to 250 m.",boom call;Cracidae;curassow;near infrasound;vocal activity;vocal repertoire,JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY,2011,SEP,Article,English,Ornithology

In forest birds, it has been proposed that landscape change can cause increased predation pressure that leads to population declines or community change. Predation can also have non-lethal effects on prey, such as creating `landscapes of fear'. However, few studies have simultaneously investigated the relative contribution of regional land-use and local management to creating `landscapes of fear'. Objectives To quantify the relative contribution of regional land-use and local management to the `landscape of fear' in agricultural landscapes. Methods Bioacoustic recorders were used to quantify Eurasian Wren Troglodytes troglodytes alarm call rates in 32 naturally replicated broadleaf woodlands located in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. Results Alarm call rates (the probability of an alarm per 10 min of audio) were positively correlated with the amount of agricultural land (arable or pasture) within 500 m of a woodland (effect size of 1) and were higher when livestock were present inside a woodland (effect size of 0.78). The amount of woodland and urban land cover in the landscape also had positive but weak effects on alarm call rates. Woodlands with gamebird management had fewer alarm calls (effect size of - 0.79). Conclusions We found that measures of both regional land-use and local management contributed to the `landscape of fear' in agricultural landscapes. To reduce the impact of anthropogenic activities on `fear' levels (an otherwise natural ecological process), land-managers should consider limiting livestock presence in woodlands and creating traditional `buffer strips' (small areas of non-farmed land) at the interface between woodland edges and agricultural fields.",Agriculture;Livestock;Gamebird management;Eurasian Wren Troglodytes troglodytes;Predation risk;WrEN project,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,2020,MAR,Article,English,"Ecology;Geography, Physical;Geosciences, Multidisciplinary"

It can influence mate choice through honestly signaling the emitter's quality. Such quality may be reflected, among other factors, in body condition and bite force. The Green-winged Saltator (Saltator similis) is a good model species to assess such relationships because males defend their territories throughout the year and sing a stereotyped song, which is known to be associated with sexual selection. The objective of this work is to assess the relationships among song structure, vocal individuality, and possible fitness indicators (body condition, morphology, and bite force) in captive male Green-winged Saltators. We conducted a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to assess vocal individuality and to highlight the principal acoustic variables associated with it. We conducted Y-Aware PCAs to evaluate the relationship between the body condition index, bite force, and morphometric and bioacoustic variables. The morphometric variables, particularly head width and length, explained 23\% of the bite force variation. The acoustic variation explained 36.17\% of body condition index variation, but a small nonsignificant amount of bite force (12\%). From the acoustic variables, peak frequency and high frequency of the last syllable, slope of the first syllable, and emission rate showed significant negative relationships with body condition. The LDA model based on acoustic variables had a 97.47\% accuracy, although this result might also reflect regional song dialects. The acoustic variables most relevant to individual classification (first syllable duration, last syllable duration, whole-song slope, and whole-song duration) are not the same variables that had a stronger relationship to body condition. Besides that, there can be a weaker mixed signaling, as variables related to frequency modulations were important in both contexts. Our results suggest that the song may act as an honest signal of an individual's body condition in this species.",animal behavior;bioacoustics;birds;honest signaling;sexual selection;territory defense,WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY,2022,MAR,Article,English,Ornithology

However, conflicting results and lack of consensus on best practices for their usage has hindered their application in conservation and land-use management contexts. Here we propose that the sensitivity of acoustic indices to ecological change and fidelity of acoustic indices to ecological communities are negatively impacted by signal masking. Signal masking can occur when acoustic responses of taxa sensitive to the effect of interest are masked by less-sensitive acoustic groups, or target taxa sonification is masked by non-target noise. We argue that by calculating acoustic indices at ecologically appropriate time and frequency bins, masking effects can be reduced and the efficacy of indices increased. We test this on a large acoustic dataset collected in Eastern Amazonia spanning a disturbance gradient of undisturbed, logged, burned, logged-and-burned and secondary forests. We calculated values for two acoustic indices: the Acoustic Complexity Index and the Bioacoustic Index, across the entire frequency spectrum (0-22.1 kHz), and four narrower subsets of the frequency spectrum; at dawn, day, dusk and night. We show that signal masking has a large impact on the sensitivity of acoustic indices to forest disturbance classes. Calculating acoustic indices at a range of narrower time-frequency bins substantially increases the classification accuracy of forest classes by random forest models. Furthermore, signal masking led to misleading correlations, including spurious inverse correlations, between biodiversity indicator metrics and acoustic index values compared to correlations derived from manual sampling of the audio data. Consequently, we recommend that acoustic indices are calculated either at a range of time and frequency bins, or at a single narrow bin, predetermined by a priori ecological understanding of the soundscape.",acoustic indices;Amazonia;bioacoustics;biodiversity;ecoacoustics;remote sensing;soundscape;tropical ecology,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2021,MAR,Article,English,Ecology

We subjected 26 ornithologists to a set of 48 bird skins belonging to 20 controversial taxonomic complexes and observed a wide variance in scoring results, in most cases straddling anywhere from far below to above the species threshold of the 7-point rule and casting doubt on claims of high reproducibility. For a detailed assessment of genuine taxonomic discord, we compared the taxonomic coverage of the avifauna of the Indonesian Archipelago (comprising similar to 1,400 species) between the HBW/BirdLife checklist, other major authorities, and the peer-reviewed literature. We detected that controversial treatments supported by the 7-point rule but at odds with the peer-reviewed literature predominantly refer to lumps, not splits, which are the usual subject of modern taxonomic quarrels. Notably, the method tends to unite morphologically (and sometimes vocally) cryptic forms into single larger species because of its inability to accommodate molecular and massive bioacoustic datasets that would indicate otherwise. On the other hand, the 7-point rule has produced numerous novel proposals for splits that may or may not be corroborated by future peer-reviewed inquiry. We recommend the 7-point rule as one of the multiple unofficial exploratory tools to flag cases of potentially cryptic species requiring further inquiry, but we advise against its adoption by other taxonomic authorities and the ornithological community.",bird classification;checklists;reproducibility;taxonomic incongruence;Tobias criteria,ORNITHOLOGY,2021,APR 6,Article,English,Ornithology

The Barusan Shama Copsychus (malabaricus) melanurus, a highly-prized songster from the West Sumatran Archipelago, is one of the most threatened taxa in Asia's songbird trade crisis, yet its predicament is often overlooked because some taxonomists treat it as a mere subspecies of the widespread White-rumped Shama C. malabaricus. Here, we provide the first modern comprehensive assessment of the on-the-ground status of Barusan Shamas across all major islands of the West Sumatran Archipelago based on visual and bioacoustic surveys, mist-netting activity, as well as community interviews covering approximately the last five years. A lack of ornithological field records across many years as well as documented drops in local capture rates indicate that increasing poaching pressure and market value have likely driven the Barusan Shama to extinction in the wild on all islands except Siberut. Even on Siberut, we document a drastic population crash and estimate impending extinction in the wild within perhaps five years in the absence of considerable changes in human behaviour. The decline and presumed extermination of some Barusan Shama island populations was so precipitous that it became evident even within our five-year monitoring period. Although our field efforts and those of others must continue, this bird's future now likely hinges on ex situ conservation efforts. The Barusan Shama occurs in four described subspecies, each endemic to its own island group, further complicating conservation efforts. Although the nominate subspecies melanurus remains relatively common in captivity on Nias and Mentawai, the other three subspecies are currently known from captive populations of a magnitude of about 100 for hypolizus, a handful for opisthochrus and zero for mirabilis, casting doubt on whether ex situ efforts can be initiated fast enough to assure the survival of individual subspecies.",,FORKTAIL,2019,,Article,English,Ornithology

Acoustic recording units are widely used in field data collection, but the facilities to reliably process the data recorded - recognizing calls that are relatively infrequent, and often significantly degraded by noise and distance to the microphone - are not well-developed yet. We propose a call detection method for continuous field recordings that can be trained quickly and easily on new species, and degrades gracefully with increased noise or distance from the microphone. The method is based on the reconstruction of the sound from a subset of the wavelet nodes (elements in the wavelet packet decomposition tree). It is intended as a preprocessing filter, therefore we aim to minimize false negatives: false positives can be removed in subsequent processing, but missed calls will not be looked at again. We compare our method to standard call detection methods, and also to machine learning methods (using as input features either wavelet energies or Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) on real-world noisy field recordings of six bird species. The results show that our method has higher recall (proportion detected) than the alternative methods: 87\% with 85\% specificity on >53 hr of test data, resulting in an 80\% reduction in the amount of data that needed further verification. It detected >60\% of calls that were extremely faint (far away), even with high background noise. This preprocessing method is available in our AviaNZ bioacoustic analysis program and enables the user to significantly reduce the amount of subsequent processing required (whether manual or automatic) to analyse continuous field recordings collected by spatially and temporally large-scale monitoring of animal species. It can be trained to recognize new species without difficulty, and if several species are sought simultaneously, filters can be run in parallel.",acoustic surveys;automated birdsong recognition;ecoacoustics;false negatives;field recordings;machine learning;wavelet filters;wavelets,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2020,MAR,Article,English,Ecology

The loss of habitat structures has a detrimental effect on biodiversity and affects bat species that depend on vegetation structures for foraging and commuting. We investigated the impact of connectivity and configuration of structural landscape elements on flight activity, species richness and diversity of insectivorous bats and distinguished three bat guilds according to species-specific bioacoustic characteristics. We tested whether bats with shorter-range echolocation were more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than bats with longer-range echolocation. We expected to find different connectivity thresholds for the three guilds and hypothesized that bats prefer linear over patchy landscape elements. Bat activity was quantified using repeated acoustic monitoring in 225 locations at 15 study plots distributed across the Swiss Central Plateau, where connectivity and the shape of landscape elements were determined by spatial analysis (GIS). Spectrograms of bat calls were assigned to species with the software batit by means of image recognition and statistical classification algorithms. Bat activity was significantly higher around landscape elements compared to open control areas. Short- and long-range echolocating bats were more active in well-connected landscapes, but optimal connectivity levels differed between the guilds. Species richness increased significantly with connectivity, while species diversity did not (Shannon's diversity index). Total bat activity was unaffected by the shape of landscape elements. Synthesis and applications. This study highlights the importance of connectivity in farmland landscapes for bats, with shorter-range echolocating bats being particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. More structurally diverse landscape elements are likely to reduce population declines of bats and could improve conditions for other declining species, including birds. Activity was highest around optimal values of connectivity, which must be evaluated for the different guilds and spatially targeted for a region's habitat configuration. In a multi-species approach, we recommend the reintroduction of structural elements to increase habitat heterogeneity should become part of agri-environment schemes.",acoustic monitoring;agricultural landscape;automated species recognition;conservation;echolocation;fragmentation;structural elements,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2013,FEB,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Ecology

Huge amounts of audio data have been gathered in the past and since the popularisation of automatic recording units the data are piling up exponentially. The point in gathering them is to analyse them, evaluate insights and hypotheses, identify patterns of activity that are otherwise not apparent and finally design policies on biodiversity issues. For massive volumes of data even visual inspection of spectrograms is unfeasible and interesting cases that could provide valuable insight for concrete hypotheses on the biodiversity status can slip into bliss. In this paper we research a range of techniques that work with minor human supervision. These techniques will construct a dictionary of templates extracted in an unsupervised way from reference recordings and then crawl over a large number of recordings to examine the underlying bioacoustic activity. This work is general and we have applied it to many datasets of animal's vocalisations (e.g. cetaceans, mice, birds). To test our tools objectively and for the sake of reproducibility in this work we report on the MLSP 2013 bird dataset that recently has been publicly released along with all its annotations. We are not interested as to which is the best scoring approach for this dataset Our aim is to describe novel machine learning tools that try to refine our understanding of biodiversity by answering questions such as: Is the recording under examination void of bird vocalisations or not? If there is bird activity, how many different species are in the recording? What are the most important characteristic spectral segments for recognizing a specific species? The database however is valuable to us to quantify our findings.

Typically, song is an acoustically complex signal; however, the fee-bee song of the black-capped chickadee is relatively simple. Despite this relative simplicity, two previous studies (Christie et al., 2004b; Hoeschele et al., 2010) found acoustic features within the fee-bee song that contain information regarding an individual's dominance rank; however each of these studies reported a different dominance-related acoustic cue. Specifically, the relative amplitude of the two notes differed between the songs of dominant and subordinate males from northern British Columbia, while the interval pitch ratio differed between the songs of dominant and subordinate males from eastern Ontario. In the current study, we examined six acoustic features within songs from both of the chickadee populations (northern British Columbia and eastern Ontario) examined in these previous studies and used bioacoustic analyses and discriminant function analyses to determine whether there is a consistent dominance-related acoustic cue across both, or in each of these populations. Consistent with the previous findings, the current results indicate that relative amplitude differs based on dominance status in the songs from British Columbia; however, our results failed to reach significance with songs from Ontario. These results suggest that acoustic cues that signal a male's dominance in this species vary with geographic location. Furthermore, examining songs from these two locations and one additional location in northern British Columbia, we found that discriminant function analyses could correctly classify songs based on geographic location. Considering the broad extent of the species' range, black-capped chickadee song is considered relatively invariant; however, our results suggest that there is geographic variation in songs, although the differences are subtle compared to geographic song variation in other species.",black-capped chickadees;fee-bee song;dominance;geographic variation;song structure,BEHAVIOUR,2013,,Article,English,Behavioral Sciences;Zoology

Recording alpha diversity is crucial for protecting biodiversity, especially in areas of elevated species richness, which coincide geographically with increased anthropogenic environmental pressures - the world's so-called biodiversity hotspots. Although the distribution of Puddle frogs of the genus Occidozyga in South and Southeast Asia includes five biodiversity hotspots, the available data on phylogeny, species diversity, and biogeography are surprisingly patchy. Samples analyzed in this study were collected throughout Southeast Asia, with a primary focus on Sundaland and the Philippines. A mitochondrial gene region comprising similar to 2000 bp of 12S and 16S rRNA with intervening tRNA Valine and three nuclear loci (BDNF, NTF3, POMC) were analyzed to obtain a robust, time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis. We found a surprisingly high level of genetic diversity within Occidozyga, based on uncorrected p-distance values corroborated by species delimitation analyses. This extensive genetic diversity revealed 29 evolutionary lineages, defined by the > 5\% uncorrected p-distance criterion for the 16S rRNA gene, suggesting that species diversity in this clade of phenotypically homogeneous forms probably has been underestimated. The comparison with results of other anuran groups leads to the assumption that anuran species diversity could still be substantially underestimated in Southeast Asia in general. Many genetically divergent lineages of frogs are phenotypically similar, indicating a tendency towards extensive morphological conservatism. We present a biogeographic reconstruction of the colonization of Sundaland and nearby islands which, together with our temporal framework, suggests that lineage diversification centered on the landmasses of the northern Sunda Shelf. This remarkably genetically structured group of amphibians could represent an exceptional case for future studies of geographical structure and diversification in a widespread anuran clade spanning some of the most pronounced geographical barriers on the planet (e.g., Wallace's Line).

Here, we show that members of the fanged frog genus Limnonectes from Ko Pha-ngan, Ko Samui, and Ko Lanta Yai Islands in southern Thailand can be distinguished from the morphologically similar species Limnonectes doriae in molecular, advertisement call, morphometric, and qualitative morphological characters. On the basis of these multiple lines of evidence, we describe the insular populations in southern Thailand as a new species, Limnonectes pseudodoriae sp. nov. The new species occurs near small streams in low to mid-elevation forests and breeds in terrestrial nests consisting of moist, clay depressions in which the eggs and larvae develop. A new species in the dicroglossid frog genus Limnonectes is described from Ko Pha-ngan, Ko Samui, and Ko Lanta Yai Islands in southern Thailand. Males of Limnonectes pseudodoriae sp. nov. lack a caruncle on top of the head and very closely resemble L. doriae (Boulenger, 1887) from Myanmar and western and southern Thailand. However, the new species is distinguished from L. doriae and its congeners using an integrative taxonomic approach of morphology, mitochondrial DNA, and bioacoustics. Limnonectes pseudodoriae sp. nov. differs from L. doriae and its congeners by having a unique combination of morphological characters, including body size; skin texture of the interorbital region, dorsum, and shank; toe webbing; relative size of the inner metatarsal tubercle; and coloration of the tympanum, venter, and ova. The advertisement call of the new species is also readily differentiated from that of L. doriae in temporal parameters. Limnonectes pseudodoriae sp. nov. is highly divergent in mitochondrial DNA from L. doriae and its congeners, but its phylogenetic position within the genus is not resolved.

The advent of new technologies for molecular and morphological data acquisition and analysis, allied to the integration of knowledge from different areas, such as ecology and population genetics, allows for the emergence of more rigorous, accurate and complete scientific hypothesis on species diversity. Mustached bats (genus Pteronotus) are a good model for the application of this integrative approach. They are a widely distributed and a morphologically homogeneous group, but comprising species with remarkable differences in their echolocation strategy and feeding behavior. The latest systematic review suggested six species with 17 subspecies in Pteronotus. Subsequent studies using discrete morphological characters supported the same arrangement. However, recent papers reported high levels of genetic divergence among conspecific taxa followed by bioacoustic and geographic agreement, suggesting an underestimated diversity in the genus. To date, no study merging genetic evidences and morphometric variation along the entire geographic range of this group has been attempted. Based on a comprehensive sampling including representatives of all current taxonomic units, we attempt to delimit species in Pteronotus through the application of multiple methodologies and hierarchically distinct datasets. The molecular approach includes six molecular markers from three genetic transmission systems; morphological investigations used 41 euclidean distances estimated through three-dimensional landmarks collected from 1628 skulls. The phylogenetic analysis reveals a greater diversity than previously reported, with a high correspondence among the genetic lineages and the currently recognized subspecies in the genus. Discriminant analysis of variables describing size and shape of cranial bones support the rising of the genetic groups to the specific status. Based on multiples evidences, we present an updated taxonomic arrangement composed by 16 extant species and a new and more robust phylogenetic hypothesis for the species included in the genus Pteronotus. Studies developed under such integrative taxonomic approach are timely for a deeper and wider comprehension of Neotropical diversity, representing the first step for answering broader questions on evolutionary and ecological aspects of Neotropical life history.

Nonetheless, meeting occupancy modeling assumptions and providing biologically accurate information are difficult tasks over long time periods, large areas, or when monitoring multiple species. In occupancy modeling frameworks, derived grids are commonly used to divide landscapes into discrete units. Grid sizes that match the home range size of the species of interest are considered optimal, but this practice is complicated as home range size may vary by sex, habitat quality, or among species. Additionally, studies often assume their survey methods sample an entire grid cell when the actual effective sampling area may be much smaller. The effect of reduced effective sampling area on occupancy estimation has received little attention to date, despite being flagged as a critical issue. In this study, we assessed (1) how the relationship between effective area, home range size, and grid size affects power to detect trends in occupancy; (2) how varying the sampling design factors of effective area, duration, detection probability, and resurvey interval influence monitoring efficiency; and (3) determine whether a single sampling design can simultaneously detect declines in two species with different home range sizes. We used a spatially explicit simulation framework to create biologically realistic declining populations over 10 yr and assessed statistical power to detect known declines using occupancy modeling. We found that effective area and detection probability had the greatest influence on statistical power. We could not reliably detect declines when detection probability was low or when effective sampling area was <1/4 cell. We conclude that failing to account for effective area less than the cell size will result in overestimation of statistical power. Our simulations suggest occupancy models can detect declines for two species with different home range sizes using the same grid cell size under certain conditions, for instance, surveying >25\% of the landscape, >= 25\% effective area, and fixed sampling locations. Further, increasing resampling interval greatly increased monitoring efficiency. Our results show monitoring planning requires explicit consideration of effective sampling area and methods with sufficient detectability to detect population declines.",bioacoustic monitoring;carnivore;effective area;Martes caurina;multispecies monitoring;non-invasive monitoring;occupancy models;passive monitoring;Pekania pennanti;population trend;remote camera;statistical power,ECOSPHERE,2021,MAY,Article,English,Ecology

The analysis of soundscapes offers easy, rapid and sustainable methods when assessing biodiversity. During the last years the quantification of regional or global acoustic variability in sounds and the analysis of different soundscapes has been evolving into an important tool for biodiversity conservation, especially since case studies confirmed a relationship between land-use management, forest structure and acoustic diversity. Here we analyzed soundscapes from two seasons (dry and rainy season) and aurally inspected a subset of audio recordings to describe temporal patterns in soundscape composition. Several acoustic indices were calculated and we performed a correlation analysis and a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis to identify acoustic indices that: (i) were complementary to each other and such represented different aspects of the local soundscapes and (ii) related most strongly to differences in acoustic composition among tree species richness, season and day phase. Thus, we chose ``High Frequency Cover,{''} ``Bioacoustic Index,{''} and ``Events Per Second{''} to test the hypothesis that acoustic diversity increases with increasing tree species richness. Monocultures differed significantly from polycultures during night recordings, with respect to High Frequency Cover. This index covers sounds above 8 kHz and thus represents part of the orthopteran community. We conclude that increasing tree species richness in a young tropical forest plantation had positive effects on the vocalizing communities. The strongest effects were found for acoustic activity of the orthopteran community.

PURE-TONES,"SAMSDODD,F;CAPRANICA,RR",Cornell University,"A systematic study of the encoding properties of 146 auditory nerve fibers in the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko, L) was conducted with respect to pure tones and two-tone rate suppression. Our aim was a comprehensive understanding of the peripheral encoding of simple tonal stimuli and their representation by temporal synchronization and spike rate codes as a prelude to subsequent studies of more complex signals. Auditory nerve fibers in the Tokay gecko have asymmetrical, V-shaped excitatory tuning curves with best excitatory frequencies that range from 200-5100 Hz and thresholds between 4-35 dB SPL. A low-frequency excitatory `tail' extends far into the low-frequency range and two-tone suppression is present only on the high frequency side of the tuning curve. The response properties to pure tones at different loci within a tuning curve can differ greatly, due to evident interactions between the representations of temporal, spectral and intensity stimulus features. For frequencies below 1250 Hz, pure tones are encoded by both temporal synchronization and spike rate codes, whereas above this frequency a fiber's ability to encode the waveform periodicity is lost and only a rate code predominates. These complimentary representations within a tuning curve raise fundamental issues which need to be addressed in interpreting how more complex, bioacoustic communication signals are represented in the peripheral and central auditory system. And since auditory nerve fibers in the Tokay gecko exhibit tonal sensitivity, selective frequency tuning, and iso-intensity and iso-frequency contours that seem comparable to similar measures in birds and mammals, these issues likely apply to most higher vertebrates in general. The simpler wiring diagram of the reptilian auditory system, coupled with the Tokay gecko's remarkable vocalizations, make this animal a good evolutionary model in which to experimentally explore the encoding of more complex sounds of communicative significance.",INFORMATION PROCESSING;PERIPHERAL AUDITORY SYSTEM;REPTILES;SPECTRAL DOMAIN;TEMPORAL DOMAIN;TOKAY GECKO,HEARING RESEARCH,1994,JUN 1,Article,English,Audiology \& Speech-Language Pathology;Neurosciences;Otorhinolaryngology

Using bioacoustic, biometric, and spectrophotometric data from a flycatcher (Tyrannidae) system in the Neotropical genus Zimmerius, we document a mosaic pattern of phenotypic admixture in which a population of Zimmerius viridiflavus in northern Peru (henceforth ``mosaic{''}) is vocally and biometrically similar to conspecifics to the south but shares plumage characteristics with a different species (Zimmerius chrysops) to the north. To clarify the origins of the mosaic population, we used the RAD-seq approach to generate a data set of 37,361 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A range of population-genetic diagnostics shows that the genome of the mosaic population is largely indistinguishable from southern Z. viridiflavus and distinct from northern Z. chrysops, and the application of parsimony and species tree methods to the genome-wide SNP data set confirms the close affinity of the mosaic population with southern Z. viridiflavus. Even so, using a subset of 2710 SNPs found across all sampled lineages in configurations appropriate for a recently proposed statistical ({''}ABBA/BABA{''}) test that distinguishes gene flow from incomplete lineage sorting, we detected low levels of gene flow from northern Z. chrysops into the mosaic population. Mapping the candidate loci for introgression from Z. chrysops into the mosaic population to the zebra finch genome reveals close linkage with genes significantly enriched in functions involving cell projection and plasma membranes. Introgression of key alleles may have led to phenotypic assimilation in the plumage of mosaic birds, suggesting that selection may have been a key factor facilitating introgression.",gene flow;hybridization;Zimmerius;tyrant-flycatcher,SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY,2014,MAR,Article,English,Evolutionary Biology

The development of rapid monitoring approaches amenable to collection at community level, yet recognised by policymakers, remains a challenge. Technologies can increase the scope of data collection. Two promising visual and audio approaches are (i) 3D habitat models, generated through photogrammetry from video footage, providing assessment of coral cover structural metrics and (ii) audio, from which acoustic indices shown to correlate to vertebrate and invertebrate diversity, can be extracted. Methods: We collected audio and video imagery using low cost underwater cameras (GoPro Hero7 (TM)) from 34 reef samples from West Papua (Indonesia). Using photogrammetry one camera was used to generate 3D models of 4 m(2) reef, the other was used to estimate fish abundance and collect audio to generate acoustic indices. We investigated relationships between acoustic metrics, fish abundance/diversity/functional groups, live coral cover and reef structural metrics. Results: Generalized linear modelling identified significant but weak correlations between live coral cover and structural metrics extracted from 3D models and stronger relationships between live coral and fish abundance. Acoustic indices correlated to fish abundance, species richness and reef functional metrics associated with overfishing and algal control. Acoustic Evenness (1,200-11,000 Hz) and Root Mean Square RMS (100-1,200 Hz) were the best individual predictors overall suggesting traditional bioacoustic indices, providing information on sound energy and the variability in sound levels in specific frequency bands, can contribute to reef assessment. Conclusion: Acoustics and 3D modelling contribute to low-cost, rapid reef assessment tools, amenable to community-level data collection, and generate information for coral reef management. Future work should explore whether 3D models of standardised transects and acoustic indices generated from low cost underwater cameras can replicate or support `gold standard' reef assessment methodologies recognised by policy makers in marine management.",Photogrammetry;Soundscape;Acoustic indices;Coral reef;Monitoring,PEERJ,2021,FEB 8,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

The molecular trees provide strong evidence for the polyphyly of several nominal species as they were previously defined, especially of Anodonthyla boulengeri and A. nigrigularis. As a consequence, we here resurrect the nomen Mantella pollicaris Boettger as Anodonthyla pollicaris from the synonymy of A. boulengeri, and we describe four new species, all with strong genetic divergences to other nominal species: Anodonthyla emilei from Ranomafana National Park, a comparatively medium-sized species characterized by a multi-note advertisement call with high note repetition rate; A. theoi from Manombo Special Reserve, a small species characterized by low note repetition rate, long note duration and high spectral call frequency; A. vallani, a medium-sized species from Ambohitantely Special Reserve, characterized by low note repetition rate, long note duration and low spectral call frequency; and A. jeanbai, a small species from Andohahela National Park, characterized by a long and narrow head, presence of short dorsolateral folds, a very short first finger, and a yellowish ventral colour. A further candidate species comprises populations previously assigned to A. boulengeri from the Ranomafana region, which we do not describe because the corresponding data set is too fragmentary, and we refer to it as A. sp. aff. boulengeri `Ranomafana'. The molecular phylogeny indicates recurrent shifts between high and low note repetition rates in calls, based mainly on three strongly supported sister groups: A. moramora with low repetition rate and A. nigrigularis with moderately low repetition rate; A. theoi with low repetition rate and A. pollicaris with high repetition rate; and A. vallani with low repetition rate and A. sp. aff. boulengeri `Ranomafana' with high repetition rate. The two species with the northernmost ranges, A. hutchisoni and A. boulengeri, are phylogenetically nested within clades of species occurring further south, confirming that the center of origin of the genus Anodonthyla was most likely in the South East of Madagascar.",Amphibia;Anura;Cophylinae;integrative taxonomy;Microhylidae;new species,CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY,2010,,Article,English,Zoology

This is resulting in the loss and degradation of green and blue spaces (e.g. parks, waterways, lakes) in cities, which provide resources to sustain biodiversity and improve human wellbeing. The specific characteristics of these spaces (e.g. sounds, species, safety) that enhance or detract from wellbeing are underexplored, yet this knowledge is needed to inform urban planning, management and policies that will ultimately benefit both people and biodiversity. Research of this kind is rarely conducted in the Global South, where rapid urbanisation threatens biodiversity rich ecosystems of worldwide significance. Here, we examine how perceptions of green, waterway, and dense urban spaces relate to wellbeing in Georgetown, Guyana. Specifically, we use mediation models to test how perceptions of sound, bird species richness, naturalness, and safety concerns contribute to sites being perceived as restorative which, subsequently, influences wellbeing. We assess the accuracy of these site perceptions with objective measures of sound (using a bioacoustic sound index), bird species richness, and percent coverage of vegetation, water, and impervious surfaces. Results showed that if sites were perceived as species rich, containing natural sounds like birdsong, natural rather than artificial, and safe, they were perceived as more restorative, resulting in improved wellbeing. In general, people's perceptions were consistent with objective measures. Green, compared with waterway and dense urban sites, contained more biophonic sounds, higher species richness, greater vegetation and water coverage. Although waterways were biodiverse, they were dominated by anthrophonic sounds, so were perceived as artificial and non-restorative. We shed light on how city planners might augment specific characteristics to improve the wellbeing of urban dwellers, with implications for biodiversity conservation. Our findings provide a scientific evidence base for urban design and management plans that could deliver multiple co-benefits, particularly in biodiversity-rich cities in neotropical regions.

10.1002/ece3.2730,Designing better frog call recognition models,"Crump,PaulS.;Houlahan,Jeff",,"Advances in bioacoustic technology, such as the use of automatic recording devices, allow wildlife monitoring at large spatial scales. However, such technology can produce enormous amounts of audio data that must be processed and analyzed. One potential solution to this problem is the use of automated sound recognition tools, but we lack a general framework for developing and validating these tools. Recognizers are computer models of an animal sound assembled from ``training data{''} (i.e., actual samples of vocalizations). The settings of variables used to create recognizers can impact performance, and the use of different settings can result in large differences in error rates that can be exploited for different monitoring objectives. We used Song Scope (Wildlife Acoustics Inc.) to build recognizers and vocalizations of the wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus) to test how different settings and amounts of training data influence recognizer performance. Performance was evaluated using precision (the probability of a recognizer match being a true match) and sensitivity (the proportion of vocalizations detected) based on a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve-determined score threshold. Evaluations were conducted using recordings not used to build the recognizer. Wood frog recognizer performance was sensitive to setting changes in four out of nine variables, and small improvements were achieved by using additional training data from different sites and from the same recording, but not from different recordings from the same site. Overall, the effect of changes to variable settings was much greater than the effect of increasing training data. Additionally, by testing the performance of the recognizer on vocalizations not used to build the recognizer, we discovered that Type I error rates appear idiosyncratic and do not recommend extrapolation from training to new data, whereas Type II errors showed more consistency and extrapolation can be justified. Optimizing variable settings on independent recordings led to a better match between recognizer performance and monitoring objectives. We provide general recommendations for application of this methodology with other species and make some suggestions for improvements.",amphibian monitoring;automated acoustic monitoring;Lithobates sylvaticus;song scope;sound recognition models;transferability;type I and II errors;wood frogs,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2017,MAY,Article,English,Ecology;Evolutionary Biology

In pigs, manipulable materials are mandatory when no bedding is available. Like manipulable objects, positive human interactions might also be considered as enrichment, as they provide the animals with opportunities to interact, increase their activity and lead to positive emotional states. In this study, we investigated how weaned pigs perceived an inanimate manipulable object and a familiar human. After a similar (in length, frequency, and procedure) familiarization to both stimuli, 24 weaned pigs were tested for a potential preference for one of the stimuli and submitted to isolation/reunion tests to evaluate the emotional value of the stimuli. We hypothesized that being reunited with a stimulus would attenuate the stress of social isolation and promote a positive state, especially if the stimulus had a positive emotional value for pigs. Although our behavioral data showed no evidence that pigs spent more time close to, or in contact with, one of the stimuli during a choice test, pigs more often approached the human and were observed lying down only near the human. Using behavioral and bioacoustic data from isolation/reunion tests, we showed that a reunion with the human decreased the time spent in an attentive state and mobility of pigs to a greater extent than a reunion with the object, or isolation. Vocalizations differed between reunions with the object and the human, and were different from those during isolation. The human and object presence led to higher frequency range and more noisy grunts, but only the human led to the production of positive shorter grunts, usually associated with positive situations. In conclusion, pigs seemed to be in a more positive emotional state, or be reassured, in the presence of a familiar human compared to the object after a short period of social isolation. This confirms the potential need for positive pseudo-social interactions with a human to enrich the pigs' environment, at least in or after potentially stressful situations.",enrichment;welfare;emotional reactivity;human-animal relationship;behavior;acoustic communication,FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE,2020,NOV 27,Article,English,Veterinary Sciences

Protecting the integrity of the urban ecosystem requires long-term monitoring and planning for resilience as well as effective management. The soundscape assessment has attracted attention in this field, but applying the soundscape assessment in urban ecological monitoring requires a protocol that links soundscapes to the impact of resource management on biodiversity over time. The effective processing and visualization of large-scale data also remains an important challenge. The aim of this study was to better understand the relationship between soundscape and physical environment, and examine the feasibility of this innovative soundscape approach in highly urbanized areas. Soundscape recordings were collected for 20 urban parks twice on 4 consecutive days in Spring. A total of 691,200 min of sound material were automatically obtained. In order to track the spatio-temporal patterns of a soundscape and determine its potential suitability for ecosystem monitoring, our study characterized soundscape information by adopting 4 widely used acoustic indices: acoustic diversity index (ADI), bioacoustic index (BIO), normalized difference vegetation index (NDSI), and power spectral density (PSD). Daily patterns of PSD have provided a potential connection between soundscapes and bird songs, and 1-2 kHz presented a similar pattern that was linked to human activity. Through further modeling, we tested the relationship of soundscapes to physical environment characteristics. The results showed the importance of habitat vegetation structure for acoustic diversity. More vertical heterogeneity, with an uneven canopy height or multilayered vegetation, was associated with more acoustic diversity. This suggests that clearing ground cover may have a significant negative impact on wildlife. Our results suggest that soundscape approaches provide a way to quickly synthesize large-scale recording data into meaningful patterns that can track changes in bird songs and ecosystem conditions. The proposed approach would enable regular assessment of urban parks and forests to inform adaptive planning and management strategies that can maintain or enhance biodiversity.",Urban biodiversity;Ecosystem monitoring;Urban gradient;Soundscape;Vegetation structure;Urban parks;Urban forest management,URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING,2022,MAY,Article,English,Plant Sciences;Environmental Studies;Forestry;Urban Studies

Nocturnal bird song is relatively common in diurnal species, yet research on this behaviour accounts for little of the research on avian vocalisations. This is surprising given that diurnal species are adapted for bright environments and therefore may be particularly sensitive to change in the lunar cycles. We used automated bioacoustic recorders and automatic song detection software to measure nocturnal song rate in a diurnal bird where both sexes sing, the willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys). We deployed recorders at eight locations across four naturally dark sites resulting in 457 h of nocturnal audio. We confirmed anecdotal evidence suggesting that willie wagtails are prolific nocturnal singers during the breeding season and demonstrate that while both male and females sing during the day, nocturnal song is largely sung by males. Moreover, we show that nocturnal song increased with lunar illumination, contrasting with previous research on other diurnal species that sing at night. Our data allow us to hypothesise possible functions for nocturnal song in this species, such as territory defence or mate attraction. Significance statement Despite being taxonomically widespread, nocturnal birdsong is largely overlooked in the literature. Anecdotal evidence suggests nocturnal song is positively influenced by the intensity of moonlight but evidence corroborating this is minimal and conflicting. More problematic is that all previous studies are biased towards male song from Northern Hemisphere species. We addressed these gaps by measuring nocturnal song, over the entire lunar cycle, in the willie wagtail, an Australian species. We demonstrate that nocturnal songs are from chorusing males during the breeding season exclusively and that nocturnal song rate increases with lunar illumination. Our work provides a foundation for hypothesizing the function of nocturnal song and contributes to understanding these patterns on a global level.",Nocturnal song;Lunar cycle;Bird song;Willie wagtail;Lunar illumination;Behaviour,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY,2020,AUG 13,Article,English,Behavioral Sciences;Ecology;Zoology

The study was carried out in the Niepolomicka Forest (southern Poland). An ultrasound `time-expansion' processing system with Pettersson D240x detector was used to identify bat species by their echolocation signals employing SonoBat v.2.9.7 software to analyse bioacoustic spectrograms. We set up 36 recording points located in: old-growth and young plantations within the hygric mixed coniferous forest type (Pino-Quercetum) and hygric deciduous forest type (Tilio-Carpinetum). The measurements were carried out in July 2013, from 8:30 PM to 0.00 AM. The occurrence of nine species of bats were documented (tab.) of which Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. pipistrellus, Barbastella barbastellus, Myotis myotis, M. emarginatus, and M. daubentonii had not been previously recorded in the Niepolomicka Forest. P pipistrellus, M. emarginatus, M. daubentonii, and E. serotinus were recorded only in old-growths, whereas Nyctalus leisleri, N. noctula, and P pygmaeus were found within both habitat types. Only two of the species identified in the study (M. myotis, and B. barbastellus) occurred both in the plantations and old-growth of hygric deciduous forest as well as in hygric mixed coniferous forest. None of the detected species was recorded exclusively in old-growth of hygric mixed coniferous forest type. The occurrence of a given bat species in the studied forest habitats and age classes of forest stands can be associated with the availability of prey, divergent feeding strategies, and with the adaptations affecting the nature of flight and ways of locating prey. The obtained results widened the knowledge of the species composition of bat fauna in the Niepolomicka Forest. At least 13 bat species live here. Apart from the nine species found in this study, four other species were found there in past years (Plecotus auritus, M. bechsteinii, M. brandtii and M. mystacinus).",bats;forest types;age class;echolocation,SYLWAN,2019,APR,Article,Polish,Forestry

In this study, we analyzed the effects of small dams along mountain streams on local bat communities. This work was carried out in five small streams located in the NE of Portugal using bioacoustic surveys during the summer of 2011. The present study confirms that, in the northeast areas of Portugal, the majority of bat species use artificial bodies of water for either drinking or foraging, but species differed in terms of their activity levels over the reservoirs when compared with intact stream habitats. As predicted, small dams in the study area were important centers of overall bat activity relative to other sampling areas. At the same time, feeding activity was also higher in the flooded areas. We also found that Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Myotis daubentonii, Pipistrellus kuhlii, Pipistrellus pygmaeus/Miniopterus schreibersii, Tadarida teniotis and Nyctalus leisleri/Eptesicus serotinus benefited from the presence of dam reservoirs. Hypsugo savii activity was also mostly recorded at reservoir points. However, the highest number of endangered and rare species was recorded at an intact stream habitat. This result emphasizes the relevance of riparian habitats for bats, especially for the most endangered species. The relationship between dam availability, riparian quality and bat diversity suggested that the changes in the streams promoted by damming could affect both bat species richness and activity levels, leading to changes in the overall composition of the bat community. In conclusion, this study found that small reservoirs have a significant influence on bat activity. However, dams appear to primarily benefit the most common species, while the endangered species were associated with riparian habitats. Therefore, for conservation proposes of the local bat community, riparian areas appear to be more important than reservoirs. Thus, this study provides a better understanding of the impact of small dams on bats contributing to the future management and conservation of bat species.",echolocation;Anabat;dams;water reservoirs;riparian habitats;bat activity;Pipistrellus;Myotis,ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA,2016,DEC,Article,English,Zoology

Anuran vocalizations, such as advertisement and release calls, are informative for taxonomy because species recognition can be based on those signals. Thus, a proper acoustic description of the calls may support taxonomic decisions and may contribute to knowledge about amphibian phylogeny. Methods. Here we present a perspective on advertisement call descriptions of the frog subfamily Lophyohylinae, through a literature review and a spatial analysis presenting bioacoustic coldspots (sites with high diversity of species lacking advertisement call descriptions) for this taxonomic group. Additionally, we describe the advertisement and release calls of the still poorly known treefrog, Itapotihyla langsdorffii. We analyzed recordings of six males using the software Raven Pro 1.4 and calculated the coefficient of variation for classifying static and dynamic acoustic properties. Results and Discussion. We found that more than half of the species within the subfamily do not have their vocalizations described yet. Most of these species are distributed in the western and northern Amazon, where recording sampling effort should be strengthened in order to fill these gaps. The advertisement call of I. langsdorffii is composed of 3-18 short unpulsed notes (mean of 13 ms long), presents harmonic structure, and has a peak dominant frequency of about 1.4 kHz. This call usually presents amplitude modulation, with decreasing intensity along the sequence of notes. The release call is a simple unpulsed note with an average duration of 9 ms, and peak dominant frequency around 1.8 kHz. Temporal properties presented higher variations than spectral properties at both intra- and inter-individual levels. However, only peak dominant frequency was static at intra-individual level. High variability in temporal properties and lower variations related to spectral ones is usual for anurans; The first set of variables is determined by social environment or temperature, while the second is usually related to species-recognition process.

Based on an integrative taxonomic analysis of morphology, song, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we suggest that 2 species should be recognized in the Graceful Prinia (Prinia gracilis) complex. In addition, our morphological analyses show the existence of a well-marked undescribed form in southeastern Somalia, which we name herein as a new subspecies. Prinia gracilisis a small, drab, long-tailed species with streaking above and plain pale underparts that has been suggested to fall into 2 groups: the southwestern nominate group (from Egypt to Oman) and the northeastern lepida group (from Turkey through India). However, the characters presented to justify this grouping are variable and show a mosaic pattern, and whether genetic and vocal differences exist is unknown. We found consistent between-group song differences, with the nominate group giving consistently longer inter-phrase intervals, whereas the members of the lepida group sing an essentially continuous reel. An mtDNA tree suggests a deep split between the nominate and lepida groups, with a coalescence time between these clades of similar to 2.2 million years ago. Vocal and mtDNA analyses provided evidence that the northeastern Arabian Peninsula taxon carpenteri belongs to the lepida group. We found that, of all the morphological characters proposed, only proportions and tail barring and spotting relatively consistently distinguish the 2 groups. However, these characters strongly suggest that the eastern Arabian Peninsula is populated by taxa of both the gracilis and lepida groups, in different areas, but we lack genetic and bioacoustic data to corroborate this. Although further study is needed in potential contact zones, we suggest that 2 species should be recognized in the P. gracilis complex, and we propose the retention of the English name Graceful Prinia for P. gracilis sensu stricto, while we suggest that P. lepida be known as Delicate Prinia.",integrative taxonomy;mitochondrial DNA;morphology;Prinia gracilis;vocalizations,ORNITHOLOGY,2021,APR 6,Article,English,Ornithology

These therapies seek as far as possible to minimize or offset the consequences caused by these types of pathologies and disorders in the patient. Therefore, comprehensive neurological care has been performed by neurorehabilitation therapies, to improve the patients' life quality and facilitating their performance in society. One way to know how the neurorehabilitation therapies contribute to help patients is by measuring changes in their brain activity by means of electroencephalograms (EEG). EEG data-processing applications have been used in neuroscience research to be highly computing- and data-intensive. Our proposal is an integrated system of Electroencephalographic, Electrocardiographic, Bioacoustic, and Digital Image Acquisition Analysis to provide neuroscience experts with tools to estimate the efficiency of a great variety of therapies. The three main axes of this proposal are: parallel or distributed capture, filtering and adaptation of biomedical signals, and synchronization in real epochs of sampling. Thus, the present proposal underlies a general system, whose main objective is to be a wireless benchmark in the field. In this way, this proposal could acquire and give some analysis tools for biomedical signals used for measuring brain interactions when it is stimulated by an external system during therapies, for example. Therefore, this system supports extreme environmental conditions, when necessary, which broadens the spectrum of its applications. In addition, in this proposal sensors could be added or eliminated depending on the needs of the research, generating a wide range of configuration limited by the number of CPU cores, i.e., the more biosensors, the more CPU cores will be required. To validate the proposed integrated system, it is used in a Dolphin-Assisted Therapy in patients with Infantile Cerebral Palsy and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, as well as with a neurotypical one.

However, cetaceans engage in the unusual practice of unihemispherical sleep, where only half of their brain sleeps at a time, due to their constant need for movement and breathing. Most studies of sleep in cetaceans have occurred in captivity. However, tagging devices have now developed to the point where the data collected from wild animals can be assessed against published criteria for defining sleep behaviourally. Seven acoustic and behavioural data loggers were deployed on harbour porpoises, Phocoena phocoena, in Danish waters between May 2010 and August 2011 and stayed on the animals between 53 and 72 h, recording 1884 to 2755 valid dives per animal. Parabolic dives with significantly reduced bioacoustic activity and a stereotyped behavioural pattern were identified as potential sleeping periods. The recordings for nearly half of the parabolic dives were found to contain no vocalization (echolocation clicks), significantly more than other dive types. Of the remaining parabolic dives, the click rate was, when normalized to their individual means, also significantly lower than detected in other dive types. Additionally, parabolic dives were shallow compared to all other dive types, and found to have a stereotypic low-energy profile. They were also found to contain fewer rolls and incorporate a lower vertical descent rate than most other dive types. If the data are representative, harbour porpoises spend a small, but meaningful amount of their diving time engaged in parabolic dives and thus potentially sleeping. All animals have a fundamental need for undisturbed sleep. These quiet periods thus need to be considered in studies of anthropogenic effects, but also those employing passive acoustic monitoring techniques, as well as in efforts to reduce incidental bycatch in fisheries, given the associated periods of reduced environmental awareness.

Ecoacoustic surveying is a useful way of monitoring habitats, where acoustic indices (AIs) are used to measure biodiversity by summarising the activity or diversity of biotic sounds. However, the biases introduced to AIs in acoustically complex urban habitats dominated by anthropogenic noise are not well understood. Here we measure the level of activity and diversity of the low (0-12 kHz, (l)) and high (12-96 kHz, (h)) frequency biotic, anthropogenic, and geophonic components of 2452 h of acoustic recordings from 15 sites across Greater London, UK from June to October 2013 based on acoustic and visual analysis of recordings. We used mixed-effects models to compare these measures to those from four commonly used Ms: Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI), Bioacoustic Index (BI), and Normalised Difference Soundscape Index (NDSI). We found that three AIs (ACI(l), BIl, NDSIl) were significantly positively correlated with our measures of biotic(l) activity and diversity. However, all three were also correlated with anthropogenict activity, and BIl and NDSIl were correlated with anthropogenic(l) diversity. All low frequency Ms were correlated with the presence of geophonic(l) sound. Regarding the high frequency recordings, only one AI (ACI(h)) was positively correlated with measured biotic(h) activity, but was also positively correlated with anthropogenic(h) activity, and no index was correlated with biotic(h) diversity. The AIs tested here are therefore not suitable for monitoring biodiversity acoustically in anthropogenically dominated habitats without the prior removal of biasing sounds from recordings.

However, if distress vocalizations produced by different species and in different contexts share a common motivational state and associated neurochemical pathways, we can expect them to share a common acoustic structure and adaptive function, showing only limited variation that corresponds to the infant's level of arousal. Based on this premise, we review the acoustic structure and adaptive function of two types of distress calls, those given when infants were isolated from their mothers (isolation calls) or captured by humans (capture calls). We conducted a within-context comparison examining the two call types across a diverse selection of mammalian species and other vertebrate groups, followed by a comparison of how acoustic structure and function differs between these contexts. In addition, we assessed acoustic traits that are critical to the response of caregivers. Across vertebrate species, distress vocalizations produced in these two behavioral contexts tend to be tonal with a simple chevron, flat or descending pattern of frequency modulation. Reports that both isolation and capture calls of vertebrate infants serve to attract caregivers are universal, and the fundamental frequency of infant vocalizations is often critical to this response. The results of our review are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in the acoustic structure of isolation and capture distress vocalizations reflect differences in arousal, and not discrete functions. The similarity in acoustic structure and caregiver response observed across vertebrates adds support to the hypothesis that the production and processing of distress vocalizations are part of a highly-conserved system of social vocal behaviour in vertebrates. Bioacoustic research may move forward by recognizing the commonality among different forms of infant solicitations that attract caregivers, and the commonality of these solicitations with vocalizations that attract conspecifics in still other behavioral contexts {[}Current Zoology 58 (5): 698-726, 2012].",Crying;Mother-infant communication;Isolation calls;Distress calls;Motivational-structural rules;Parental care;Phylogeny,CURRENT ZOOLOGY,2012,,Review,English,Zoology

This work simulated, quantified, and evaluated the thermal impact of these treatments on the rectum, pelvic bone, neurovascular bundles (NVBs), and urinary sphincters because damage to these structures can lead to complications. Methods: Twenty 3D anatomical models of prostate cancer patients were used with detailed bioacoustic simulations incorporating an active feedback algorithm which controlled a rotating, planar ultrasound transducer (17, 4 x 3 mm(2) elements, 10 W-acoustic/cm(2)). Heating of the adjacent surrounding anatomy was evaluated at 4.7, 9.7, and 14.2 MHz using thermal tolerances reported in literature. Results: Heating of the rectum posed the most important safety concern, influenced largely by the water temperature of an endorectal cooling device (ECD); depending on anatomy, temperatures of 7-37 degrees C were required to limit potential damage to less than 10 mm(3) on the outer 1 mm layer of the rectal wall. Heating of the pelvic bone could be important at 4.7 MHz. A smaller sized ECD or a higher ultrasound frequency in sectors where the bone was less than 10 mm from the prostate reduced heating in all cases below the threshold for irreversible damage. Heating of the NVB was significant in 75\% of the patient models in the absence of treatment planning; this proportion was reduced to 5\% by increasing treatment margins up to 4 mm. To avoid damaging the urinary sphincters, the transducer should be positioned at least 2-4 mm from the sphincters, depending on the transurethral cooling temperature. Conclusions: Simulations show that MRI-guided transurethral therapy can treat the prostate accurately, but in the absence of treatment planning, some thermal impact can be predicted on the surrounding anatomy. Treatment planning strategies have been developed, which reduce thermal injury to the surrounding anatomy.

The current delimitation of the genus was reached in the late 1970s, when only two species were recognized, but since then the number of described species steadily increased, reaching a maximum of 11 by 2012. Subsequent studies that applied explicit species delimitation approaches decreased the number of species to six in 2017 and raised it again to 11 the following year, including an undescribed putative species. Despite these taxonomic changes, the two species groups traditionally recognized, roseus and vertebralis, have been maintained. Another recent contribution to the taxonomy of the genus was the explicit recognition of the extremely high level of external phenotypic variation exhibited by species of the roseus group, which undermines the utility of some diagnostic characters. Here we provide a critical review of the extensive taxonomic and systematic literature on the genus over the last six decades, to examine the evidence behind the recurrent taxonomic changes and advances in its systematics. We also update and complete a 2017 review of geographic information, provide additional qualitative observations of external characters commonly used in the diagnoses of species of the roseus group, and reassess the phylogenetic position of a putative new species from Tolhuaca (Chile), which was not included in the last species delimitation study. The present review shows that: 1) there is no congruence between the patterns of phenotypic and genetic/phylogenetic differentiation among species of both groups; 2) in the roseus group, the intraspecific variation in some external characters is as high as the differences described among species; 3) there is little morphological and bioacoustic differentiation within species groups, and inconsistencies in the chromosomal evidence at the genus level; 4) under the latest taxonomic proposal (2018), species of the roseus group still lack consistent and reliable diagnoses and their distribution limits are poorly defined; and 5) the population from Tolhuaca represents an additional undescribed species under the most recent taxonomic framework. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the taxonomy and biogeography of the genus, pointing out some areas that require further research to understand their patterns and processes of diversification.",Biogeography;diagnoses;ground frogs;literature review;southern South America;species groups,ZOOKEYS,2019,JUL 11,Article,English,Zoology

But yet, for many lineages vocalizations remain unknown or poorly quantified, especially in diversity rich tropical regions. Here we provide a quantitative acoustical analysis for all four Sri Lankan congeners of the genus Microhyla. Three of these species are endemic to the island, but Microhyla ornata is regionally widespread. Two of these endemics, M. karunaratnei (Critically Endangered) and M. zeylanica (Endangered), are highly threatened montane isolates; the other, M. mihintalei, is relatively common across the dry lowlands. We recorded and analyzed 100 advertisement calls from five calling males for each species, except for M. zeylanica, which only had 53 calls from three males suitable for analyses. All four species call in choruses and their vocal repertoires are simple compared to most frogs. Their calls contain multiple pulses and no frequency modulation. We quantified eight call characters. Call duration and number of pulses were higher for the two montane isolates (inhabiting cooler habitats at higher altitudes) compared to their lowland congeners. Microhyla zeylanica has the longest call duration (of 1.8 +/- 0.12 s) and the highest number of pulses (of 6192 pulses). The smallest of the species, Microhyla karunaratnei (16.2-18.3 mm), has the highest mean dominant frequency (3.3 +/- 0.14 kHz) and pulse rate (77 +/- 5.8 pulses per second). The calls separate well in the Principal Component space: PC1 axis is mostly explained by the number of pulses per call and call duration; PC2 is mostly explained by the pulse rate. A canonical means plot of a Discriminant Function analysis shows non-overlapping 95\% confidence ellipses. This suggests that some call parameters can be used to distinguish these species effectively. We provide detailed descriptions for eight call properties and compare these with congeners for which data is available. This work provides a foundation for comparative bioacoustic analyses and species monitoring while facilitating the systematics of Microhyla across its range.",,PLOS ONE,2016,JUL 12,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

PAM is used in a range of and freshwater environments. However, financial constraints limit applications within aquatic environments; these costs include the high cost of submersible acoustic recorders. We quantify this financial constraint using a systematic literature review of all ecoacoustic studies published in 2020, demonstrating that commercially available autonomous underwater recording units are, on average, five times more expensive than their terrestrial equivalents. This pattern is more extreme at the low end of the price range; the cheapest available aquatic autonomous units are over 40 times more expensive than their terrestrial counterparts. Following this, we test a prototype low-cost, low-specification aquatic recorder called the `HydroMoth': this device is a modified version of a widely used terrestrial recorder (AudioMoth), altered to include a waterproof case and customisable gain settings suitable for a range of aquatic applications. We test the performance of the HydroMoth in both aquaria and field conditions, recording artificial and natural sounds, and comparing outputs with identical recordings taken with commercially available hydrophones. Although the signal-to-noise ratio and the recording quality of HydroMoths are lower than commercially available hydrophones, the recordings with HydroMoths still allow for the identification of different fish and marine mammal species, as well as the calculation of ecoacoustic indices for ecosystem monitoring. Finally, we outline the potential applications of low-cost, low-specification underwater sound recorders for bioacoustic studies, discuss their likely limitations, and present important considerations of which users should be aware. Several performance limitations and a lack of professional technical support mean that low-cost devices cannot meet the requirements of all PAM applications. Despite these limitations, however, HydroMoth facilitates underwater recording at a fraction of the price of existing hydrophones, creating exciting potential for diverse involvement in aquatic bioacoustics worldwide.",aquatic bioacoustics;aquatic ecosystems monitoring;bioacoustics;ecoacoustics;hydrophone;passive acoustic monitoring,REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,2022,JUN,Article,English,Ecology;Remote Sensing

Understanding these calling patterns can provide insights into how individuals modify their behavior in response to environmental variables as well as help to design efficient bioacoustic survey techniques. Eastern hoolock gibbons in Gaoligongshan inhabit the coldest habitat of all gibbon populations, but both conservation and research efforts on this population have been minimal. We studied singing patterns of two habituated and two unhabituated groups at two sites in Gaoligongshan between July 2010 and June 2015. We systematically collected data of their calls, and its relationship to temperature, group density, and hunting pressure over at least 1 year for each group. Our goal was to elucidate how these factors affect singing patterns of eastern hoolock gibbons. We found that adult pairs coordinated their singing to produce duet bouts that lasted for an average of 25.5min. The singing rate (number of bouts/number on monitoring days{*}100\%: 7.5-31.4\%) was notably lower than other gibbon populations, presumably due to low group density (about 0.5groups/km(2)) and prevalence of hunting at the study site. Cold temperature also affected gibbons' singing behavior. Our study groups called, on average, 2.5hr after sunrise, probably foraging first in the early morning after long nights in this cold habitat delayed singing. Furthermore, mean temperatures in the morning (8:00-12:00 am) were higher on singing days than on non-singing days, and one group called less frequently when monthly mean temperature was below 10 degrees C. Our findings indicate that both hunting pressure from humans and low temperatures suppress calling behavior in hoolock gibbons. Such information is critical in evaluating the use of duetting as a monitoring technique for this endangered gibbon species. Am. J. Primatol. 78:861-871, 2016.

Forest managers are increasingly confronted by alien tree species. Therefore, this case study aimed to investigate the influence of the invasive black cherry (Prunus serotina) on bats (Chiroptera: Verpertilionidae) in pine (Pinus sylvestris) forest ecosystems, in order to identify the potential of bats as bioindicators for a black cherry invasion. In three pre-classified succession stages of the black cherry, the diversity and relative abundance of bats were bioacoustically monitored for a period of 60 nights. From the bat call recordings made during the study period, eight bat species could be identified to species level. Within the succession stages of pine monoculture and light black cherry forest, a comparable bat diversity of eight bat species and three sonotypes with a similar relative abundance were observed. In dense black cherry forest, only four species and one sonotype were detected. Compared to the pine monoculture and light black cherry forest, the overall abundance of the bat community was significantly lower in the dense black cherry forest. Upon evaluation, those bat species associated with the edge and narrow space forager guilds were found to have a high sensitivity to a dense black cherry understory within naturally monocultural pine stands. Their activity patterns indicate that the transition from light to dense black cherry understory can be considered as a potential threshold value for a close-to-nature black cherry understory density in high canopy pine forest stands.",bioacoustic monitoring;bats;biological indicators;invasive species;sustainable forestry;close-to-nature forest management;nature conservation;Prunus serotina Ehrh;Chiroptera;Pipistrellus spp;Myotis spp;Plecotus spp,PLANTS-BASEL,2019,SEP,Article,English,Plant Sciences

Technological advances make it possible to accumulate many more recordings than can be listened to or interpreted, thereby necessitating automated assistance to identify elements in the soundscape. In this paper we examine the problem of estimating avian species richness by sampling from very long acoustic recordings. We work with data recorded under natural conditions and with all the attendant problems of undefined and unconstrained acoustic content (such as wind, rain, traffic, etc.) which can mask content of interest (in our case, bird calls). We describe 14 acoustic indices calculated at one minute resolution for the duration of a 24 hour recording. An acoustic index is a statistic that summarizes some aspect of the structure and distribution of acoustic energy and information in a recording. Some of the indices we calculate are standard (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio), some have been reported useful for the detection of bioacoustic activity (e.g. temporal and spectral entropies) and some are directed to avian sources (spectral persistence of whistles). We rank the one minute segments of a 24 hour recording in descending order according to an ``acoustic richness{''} score which is derived from a single index or a weighted combination of two or more. We describe combinations of indices which lead to more efficient estimates of species richness than random sampling from the same recording, where efficiency is defined as total species identified for given listening effort Using random sampling, we achieve a 53\% increase in species recognized over traditional field surveys and an increase of 87\% using combinations of indices to direct the sampling. We also demonstrate how combinations of the same indices can be used to detect long duration acoustic events (such as heavy rain and cicada chorus) and to construct long duration (24 h) spectrograms.

Selecting the duration of recording and the number of recording units are critical decisions, and we used both simulated and empirical data to quantify the trade-offs those choices present. We evaluated the performance of 30 hypothetical acoustic survey designs (e.g. continuous recording, every other 5 min, etc.). Simulated bird species' (n <= 60) abundance across the study area, probability of daily availability and time-dependent probability of vocal activity varied randomly within ranges of realistic values. Field data, collected in central New York, USA (747 hr) and in the northern Sierra Nevada, USA (1,090 hr), was analysed with a novel machine-learning algorithm, BirdNET. All three datasets were subsampled at 5-min intervals, observed species richness was compared across survey designs, and detection probability was calculated for each species. Observed species richness increased with survey coverage (number of recording units) and with recording duration in all three datasets. The impact of differences in survey coverage decreased as recording duration decreased. Species' detection probabilities were negatively affected by reducing the number of days of recording and by reducing the daily recording duration. The more rare species a community had, the more species richness was underestimated as survey coverage decreased. Rarefaction curves indicated that increasing recording time has diminishing marginal utility but that the asymptote varies among communities. The cost per species observed decreased with increasing recording duration. Discontinuous and reduced-coverage sampling may still yield fairly accurate assessments of biodiversity but reducing recording duration or coverage will result in different species remaining undetected. Whether the performance of a study design is `good' or `bad' depends on researchers' constraints and scientific questions to be answered. More hardware and longer recording durations are not always better, but we caution researchers against doing the bare minimum required for their present needs without pressing financial reasons to do so.",artificial intelligence;avian diversity;bioacoustics;bird community;convolutional neural network;ecoacoustics;machine learning;point count,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2021,MAY,Article,English,Ecology

However, the relationship between acoustic indices and topography still needs to be thoroughly evaluated, as well as the variance in the relationship at different spatial scales within the same research system. Networks of forest dynamics plots constructed under the same protocol provide an ideal research platform for addressing the above issue. Our study investigated the relationship between acoustic indices, vegetation, and topographic characteristics at two spatial scales. We recorded soundscapes using autonomous recorders across a tropical forest dynamics plot network consisting of 22 plots in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, southwest China. To exclude recordings with geophony and with biotic sounds from non-avian species, especially from cicadas and frogs, the recordings were previewed aurally and visually, with 9110 min of ``clear{''} bird acoustic recordings chosen for final analysis. We assessed the relative importance of tree species richness, six vegetation characteristics, and three topographic characteristics for five acoustic signal complexity indices, and three statistical indices which describe the properties of frequency spectrum, at 25 m and 50 m spatial scales. We found that topographic complexity was the most significant factor influencing acoustic indices. The variation explained by topographic complexity ranged from 13.2 \% to 47.2 \% for the seven best-fitted models at both spatial scales. Horizontal vegetation characteristics, including tree density and basal area, were also important variables related to acoustic indices. The Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI) and Bioacoustic Index (BIO) were not associated with vegetation or topographic characteristics at either spatial scale. Three out of seven significant relationships between acoustic indices and vegetation or topographic characteristics disappeared as the spatial scale increased from 25 m to 50 m. In contrast, the significant relationship between Acoustic entropy (H), the centroid (CENT) and skewness (SKEW) and topographic complexity remained stable. Our results suggest that both acoustic signal complexity indices and acoustic statistical indices showed a different relationship to vegetation and topographic characteristics in tropical forests, and the strength of these relationship was scale-dependent.

Camera traps have become the standard method for surveying many terrestrial mammals and birds, but camera trap arrays often generate millions of images that are time-consuming to label. This causes significant latency between data collection and subsequent inference, which impedes conservation at a time of ecological crisis. Machine learning algorithms have been developed to improve the speed of labelling camera trap data, but it is uncertain how the outputs of these models can be used in ecological analyses without secondary validation by a human. Here, we present our approach to developing, testing and applying a machine learning model to camera trap data for the purpose of achieving fully automated ecological analyses. As a case-study, we built a model to classify 26 Central African forest mammal and bird species (or groups). The model generalizes to new spatially and temporally independent data (n = 227 camera stations, n = 23,868 images), and outperforms humans in several respects (e.g. detecting `invisible' animals). We demonstrate how ecologists can evaluate a machine learning model's precision and accuracy in an ecological context by comparing species richness, activity patterns (n = 4 species tested) and occupancy (n = 4 species tested) derived from machine learning labels with the same estimates derived from expert labels. Results show that fully automated species labels can be equivalent to expert labels when calculating species richness, activity patterns (n = 4 species tested) and estimating occupancy (n = 3 of 4 species tested) in a large, completely out-of-sample test dataset. Simple thresholding using the Softmax values (i.e. excluding `uncertain' labels) improved the model's performance when calculating activity patterns and estimating occupancy but did not improve estimates of species richness. We conclude that, with adequate testing and evaluation in an ecological context, a machine learning model can generate labels for direct use in ecological analyses without the need for manual validation.

Ecoacoustic surveying is a useful way of assessing habitats, where biotic sound measured from audio recordings is used as a proxy for population abundance and/or activity. However, existing algorithms systematically over and underestimate measures of biotic activity in the presence of typical urban non-biotic sounds in recordings. We develop CityNet, a deep learning system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to measure audible biotic (CityBioNet) and anthropogenic (CityAnthroNet) acoustic activity in cities. The CNNs were trained on a large dataset of annotated audio recordings collected across Greater London, UK. Using a held-out test dataset, we compare the precision and recall of CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet separately to the best available alternative algorithms: four Acoustic Indices: Acoustic Complexity Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Bioacoustic Index, and Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, and a state-of-the-art bird call detection CNN (bulbul). We also compare the effect of non-biotic sounds on the predictions of CityBioNet and bulbul. Finally we apply CityNet to describe acoustic patterns of the urban soundscape in two sites along an urbanisation gradient. CityBioNet was the best performing algorithm for measuring biotic activity in terms of precision and recall, followed by bulbul, whereas the Acoustic Indices performed worst. CityAnthroNet outperformed the Normalised Difference Soundscape Index, but by a smaller margin than CityBioNet achieved against the competing algorithms. The CityBioNet predictions were impacted by mechanical sounds, whereas air traffic and wind sounds influenced the bulbul predictions. Across an urbanisation gradient, we show that CityNet produced realistic daily patterns of biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity from real-world urban audio data. Using CityNet, it is possible to automatically measure biotic and anthropogenic acoustic activity in cities from audio recordings.

It is possible to understand the causes and consequences of this variation across taxa with phylogenetic comparative analyses. Acoustic and evolutionary analyses are rapidly increasing in sophistication such that choosing appropriate acoustic and evolutionary approaches is increasingly difficult. However, the correct choice of analysis can have profound effects on output and evolutionary inferences. Here, we identify and address some of the challenges for this growing field by providing a roadmap for quantifying and comparing sound in a phylogenetic context for researchers with a broad range of scientific backgrounds. Sound, as a continuous, multidimensional trait can be particularly challenging to measure because it can be hard to identify variables that can be compared across taxa and it is also no small feat to process and analyse the resulting high-dimensional acoustic data using approaches that are appropriate for subsequent evolutionary analysis. Additionally, terminological inconsistencies and the role of learning in the development of acoustic traits need to be considered. Phylogenetic comparative analyses also have their own sets of caveats to consider. We provide a set of recommendations for delimiting acoustic signals into discrete, comparable acoustic units. We also present a three-stage workflow for extracting relevant acoustic data, including options for multivariate analyses and dimensionality reduction that is compatible with phylogenetic comparative analysis. We then summarize available phylogenetic comparative approaches and how they have been used in comparative bioacoustics, and address the limitations of comparative analyses with behavioural data. Lastly, we recommend how to apply these methods to acoustic data across a range of study systems. In this way, we provide an integrated framework to aid in quantitative analysis of cross-taxa variation in animal sounds for comparative phylogenetic analysis. In addition, we advocate the standardization of acoustic terminology across disciplines and taxa, adoption of automated methods for acoustic feature extraction, and establishment of strong data archival practices for acoustic recordings and data analyses. Combining such practices with our proposed workflow will greatly advance the reproducibility, biological interpretation, and longevity of comparative bioacoustic studies.",acoustic communication;phylogenetic comparative analysis;signal evolution;acoustic measurements;multivariate analysis,BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS,2021,AUG,Article,English,Biology

While such sensors are very specialized and adapted to their specific needs, the way the antenna itself is built has often been considered either uninteresting or unimportant. We used a laser to scan the antenna of the midgeChironomus riparius. Insect cuticle, if illuminated with laser light, reflects autofluorescent light, an emission that has long been known to indicate the material properties of the scanned cuticle sample. Rather than a simple beam-like structure of constant material stiffness, we saw bands of hard and soft material, distributed along the length of the antenna. We were able to computer-simulate the effect of this banded structure on the antenna's resonant frequency and showed that it allows the beam to vibrate at different frequencies than would be expected only by its shape. This discovery will help us to better understand these animals' biology and can inspire future biomimetic sensors for detecting sound or vibration. Small-scale bioacoustic sensors, such as antennae in insects, are often considered, biomechanically, to be not much more than the sum of their basic geometric features. Therefore, little is known about the fine structure and material properties of these sensors-even less so about the degree to which the well-known sexual dimorphism of the insect antenna structure affects those properties. By using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we determined material composition patterns and estimated distribution of stiffer and softer materials in the antennae of males and females of the non-biting midgeChironomus riparius. Using finite element modelling (FEM), we also have evidence that the differences in composition of these antennae can influence their mechanical responses. This study points to the possibility that modulating the elastic and viscoelastic properties along the length of the antennae can affect resonant characteristics beyond those expected of simple mass-on-a-spring systems-in this case, a simple banded structure can change the antennal frequency sensitivity. This constitutes a simple principle that, now demonstrated in another Dipteran group, could be widespread in insects to improve various passive and active sensory performances.",Chironomus riparius;Diptera;insects;confocal laser scanning microscopy;finite element modelling;antennal hearing;biomechanics;multimodal sensor,INSECTS,2020,AUG,Article,English,Entomology

Dozens of indices have been proposed to date, but systematic validation against classical, in situ diversity measures are lacking. This study conducted the most comprehensive comparative evaluation to date of the relationship between avian species diversity and a suite of acoustic indices. Acoustic surveys were carried out across habitat gradients in temperate and tropical biomes. Baseline avian species richness and subjective multi-taxa biophonic density estimates were established through aural counting by expert ornithologists. 26 acoustic indices were calculated and compared to observed variations in species diversity. Five acoustic diversity indices (Bioacoustic Index, Acoustic Diversity Index, Acoustic Evenness Index, Acoustic Entropy, and the Normalised Difference Sound Index) were assessed as well as three simple acoustic descriptors (Root-mean-square, Spectral centroid and Zero-crossing rate). Highly significant correlations, of up to 65\%, between acoustic indices and avian species richness were observed across temperate habitats, supporting the use of automated acoustic indices in biodiversity monitoring where a single vocal taxon dominates. Significant, weaker correlations were observed in neotropical habitats which host multiple non-avian vocalizing species. Multivariate classification analyses demonstrated that each habitat has a very distinct soundscape and that AIs track observed differences in habitat-dependent community composition. Multivariate analyses of the relative predictive power of AIs show that compound indices are more powerful predictors of avian species richness than any single index and simple descriptors are significant contributors to avian diversity prediction in multi-taxa tropical environments. Our results support the use of community level acoustic indices as a proxy for species richness and point to the potential for tracking subtler habitat-dependent changes in community composition. Recommendations for the design of compound indices for multi-taxa community composition appraisal are put forward, with consideration for the requirements of next generation, low power remote monitoring networks.",Biodiversity monitoring;Remote sensing;Ecoacoustics;Acoustic indices;Species richness,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,2018,DEC,Article,English,Biodiversity Conservation;Environmental Sciences
10.1002/eap.2587,Livestock grazing to maintain habitat of a critically endangered grassland bird: Is grazer species important?,"Nugent,DanielT.;Baker-Gabb,DavidJ.;Leonard,SteveW.J.;Morgan,JohnW.",La Trobe University,"Livestock grazing is an important management tool for biodiversity conservation in many native grasslands across the globe. Understanding how different grazing species interact with their environment is integral to achieving conservation goals. In the semiarid grasslands of Australia, grazing by sheep or cattle is used to manipulate vegetation structure to suit the habitat needs of a globally unique, critically endangered grassland bird, the plains-wanderer Pedionomus torquatus. However, there has been no investigation of whether sheep and cattle differ in their effects on plains-wanderer habitat and, therefore, it is unknown if these grazers are substitutable as a management tool. Using a grazing experiment in native grasslands over 3 years, we determined the effects of grazer type (sheep, cattle) on occurrence and vocal activity of plains-wanderer, vegetation structure and composition, and food availability. We also examined grazer effects on encounter rates of other grassland birds. Plains-wanderer breeding activity was inferred from vocalization rates captured by bioacoustic recorders. Spotlighting was used to measure encounter rates of other grassland birds. We found that different grazers altered the structure of the habitat. Grasslands grazed by cattle were typically more open, less variable, and lacked patches of dense vegetation relative to those grazed by sheep. Grazer type did not influence the likelihood of plains-wanderer occurrence, but it did interact with year of survey to affect breeding activity. The number of days with one or more calls significantly increased at sheep grazed sites in year-3, which coincided with enduring drought conditions. Similarly, grazer effects on encounter rate of all birds, bird species richness, and Australasian pipit Anthus novaeseelandiae were different between years. Dense vegetation specialists (such as stubble quail Coturnix pectoralis) were positively associated with grasslands grazed by sheep. As a habitat management tool, sheep or cattle grazing are useful when the goal is to support an open grassland structure for the plains-wanderer. However, their substitutability is likely to be dependent upon climate. We caution that a loss of dense vegetation in grasslands grazed by cattle during drought could limit the availability of optimal habitat for the plains-wanderer and habitat for other grassland birds.",disturbance ecology;grassland birds;habitat management;livestock grazing;plains-wanderer;rangeland,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,2022,JUL,Article,English,Ecology;Environmental Sciences

Documenting acoustic conditions among habitats can provide insights into temporal changes in ecosystem composition and anthropogenic impacts. Agencies tasked with safeguarding marine protected areas, such as the U.S. National Park Service and U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, are increasingly interested in using long-term monitoring of underwater sounds as a means of tracking species diversity and ecosystem health. In this study, low-frequency passive acoustic recordings were collected fall 2014 - spring 2018, using standardized instrumentation, from four marine protected areas across geographically disparate regions of the U.S. Economic Exclusive Zone: Northwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, South Pacific, and Caribbean. Recordings were analyzed for differences in seasonal conditions and to identify acoustic metrics useful for resource assessment across all sites. In addition to comparing ambient sound levels, a species common to all four sites, the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), was used to compare biological sound detection. Ambient sound levels varied across the sites and were driven by differences in animal vocalization rates, anthropogenic activity, and weather. The highest sound levels {[}dB(RMS(50 Hz-1.5 kHz)) re 1 mu Pa] were recorded in the Northwest Atlantic in Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary (Stellwagen) during the boreal winter-spring resulting from bioacoustic activity, vessel traffic, and high wind speeds. The lowest sound levels {[}dB(RMS(50 Hz-1.5 )(kHz)) re 1 mu Pa] were recorded in the Northeast Pacific adjacent to a vessel-restricted area of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (Glacier Bay) during the boreal summer. Humpback whales were detected seasonally in the southern latitude sites, and throughout the deployment periods in the northern latitude sites. Temporal trends in band and spectrum sound levels in Glacier Bay and the National Park of American Samoa were primarily driven by biological sound sources, while trends in Stellwagen and the Buck Island Reef National Monument were primarily driven by anthropogenic sources.

,"The summit herpetofauna of Auyantepui, Venezuela: Report from the Robert G. Goelet American Museum - TERRAMAR Expedition",{[}Anonymous],,"Auyantepui is an immense sandstone table mountain in the Venezuelan Guayana. This mesa did not appear on aviation maps and was unknown to the literate world prior to the late 1930s. It was explored from the air by Jimmy Angel; a bush pilot and colorful soldier of fortune for whom the world's highest waterfall is named (Angel Falls at the northern end of Auyantepui). About the same time, in 1937, Captain Felix Cardona Puig and Gustavo Heny discovered an access crack in the sandstone, allowing ascent onto the southern end of the mesa. The first scientific exploration followed immediately-the 1937-1938 Phelps Venezuelan Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History made the first zoological and general botanical collections. Today, no tepui other than the ``Lost World{''} of Cerro Roraima is better known to the general public. The summit of Auyantepui has a known fauna of 24 species of amphibians and reptiles, including species added by the Robert G. Goelet American Museum-TERRAMAR Expedition in 1994. This expedition collected 16 species during a month of fieldwork in the dry season (February), in five camps at elevations of 1700-2100 in above sea level. All species known from the summit of Auyantepui are treated in this bulletin; illustrations where possible include tadpoles, bioacoustic spectrograms, and hemipenes. Four new species are described-two frogs (Hypsiboas angelicus, n. sp., Eleutherodactylus auricarens, n. sp.), a lizard (Arthrosaura montigena, n. sp.), and a snake (Atractus guerreroi, n. sp.). Arthrosaura montigena possesses a hemipenial character not previously described-an orifice (orificium) of unknown function, situated in the lobular crotch between the two lobes. Attention is called to a probably undescribed snake (Liophis ``miliaris{''} sensu lato) from the nearby Gran Sabana. The herpetofauna of the Auyan summit comprises 12 families, 20 genera, and 24 species. This is compared with the known herpetofauna of the Chimanta massif, lying less than 50 kin south-southeast of Auyantepui. Despite the proximity and similar dimensions, the summits of Auyantepui and Chimanta have in common only 11\% of the combined number of species (4 of 36), 44\% of the genera (11 of 25), and 62\% of the families represented (8 of 13), showing that neighboring tepuis may have herpetofaunas very different from one another.

A detailed osteological description of this species was also provided, including skull, hyolaryngeal skeleton and postcranium skeleton. The laryngeal skeleton of Brachycephalus genus was depicted for the first time. We conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis of Brachycephalus using DNA sequences comprising two fragments of mitochondrial gene (16S). Both analysis with Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony supported the recognition of B. bufonoides as an exclusive lineage, allocated within the B. ephippium species group in B. vertebralis lineage. We improved the diagnosis and variation of the species, including more collected specimens, coloration in vivo and advertisement call description. Compared with its congeners, B. bufonoides has skin on head and dorsum with dermal hyperossification; skull with hyperossification of postorbital crests; a pair of hyperossified bulges about equidistant between postorbital crests; fourth presacral vertebra with transverse process hyperossified, ornamented and sacral diapophyses hyperossified, which can be seen externally (lineage of B. vertebralis sensu Condez et al. 2020); presence of dermal ossification as separated bulges of each vertebrae; general background color orange with different intensities of dark orange blotches on dorsum, including bordering of sacral region; absence of osteoderms and presence of warts on the dorsolateral surface of body; medium body size (SVL of adults: 12.0-14.5 mm for males and 14.7-16.3 mm for females; Table 1); rough dorsum; advertisement calls with 13 to 17 pulses; presence of pulse period modulation; and advertisement calls with notes longer than 0.2 s (0.22 to 0.31 s).

Here we investigate seven cryptic species of the golden-spectacled warbler (Seicercus burkii complex) with respect to territorial song and cytochrome-b (cyt-b) sequences. Their phylogenetic relations to other Seicercus species and to members of the genus Phylloscopus are inferred by the same methods. Three separate lineages of Seicercus are nested within different branches of the molecular Phylloscopus tree. The S. burkii complex is a monophyletic unit comprising seven species (S. burkii s. str., S. whistleri, S. valentini, S. soror, S. omeiensis, S. tephrocephalus and S. affinis). S. xanthoschistos turned out to be a close relative of Phylloscopus davisoni within the P. reguloides group. Two isolated sister taxa, S. grammiceps and S. castaniceps, also branch together with the P. reguloides group. Within the S. burkii complex the overall haplotype and nucleotide diversity is highest in taxa from the Chinese middle and upper mountain belt (S. valentini, S. omeiensis and S. soror), indicating at least partially restricted gene flow in these species. This is explained by the fragmentation of high-altitude habitats in China while in the Himalayas the vicariant species S. whistleri inhabits a more continuous mountain belt at the same altitude. For the Chinese species from medium and high altitudes, past range expansion is indicated by significantly negative Tajima Ds. According to pairwise genetic distances, most species of the S. burkii complex have diverged 5 myr ago, the most recent split between S. burkii and S. tephrocephalus is dated 2 myr ago. Coalescence times for haplotype lineages of the different species range from 9 up to 12 myr, and between 5 and 6 myr for S. burkii and S. tephrocephalus. Within Seicercus divergence of song features such as frequency parameters and syntax structures correlate with genetic distances between taxa. The three cyt-b lineages of Seicercus correspond to different clusters in a discriminant analysis by acoustic parameters. Common syntax structures of territorial song in the Phylloscopus/Seicercus assemblage are: (1) an introductory element derived from specific calls and (2) a syntax of trills and repeated element groups or a combination of both. There are clear indications that these song structures have repeatedly emerged, were lost or were altered in different branches of the phylogenetic tree at different times.

The extent to which sound in the sea impacts and affects marine life is a topic of considerable current interest both to the scientific community and to the general public. Cepaholopods potentially represent a group of species whose ecology may be influenced by artificial noise that would have a direct consequence on the functionality and sensitivity of their sensory organs, the statocysts. These are responsible for their equilibrium and movements in the water column. Controlled Exposure Experiments, including the use of a 50-400 Hz sweep (RL= 157 +/- 5 dB re 1 mu Pa with peak levels up to SPL= 175 dB re 1 mu Pa) revealed lesions in the statocysts of four cephalopod species of the Mediterranean Sea, when exposed to low frequency sounds: (n=76) of Sepia officinalis, (n=4) Octopus vulgaris, (n=5) Loligo vulgaris and (n=2) Illex condietii The analysis was performed through scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopical techniques of the whole inner structure of the cephalopods' statocyst, especially on the macula and crista. All exposed individuals presented the same lesions and the same incremental effects over time, consistent with a massive acoustic trauma observed in other species that have been exposed to much higher intensities of sound: Immediately after exposure, the damage was observed in the macula statica princeps (msp) and in the crista sensory epithelium. Kinocilia on hair cells were either missing or were bent or flaccid. A number of hair cells showed protruding apical poles and ruptured lateral plasma membranes, most probably resulting from the extrusion of cytoplasmic material. Hair cells were also partially ejected from the sensory epithelium, and spherical holes corresponding to missing hair cells were visible in the epithelium. The cytoplasmic content of the damaged hair cells showed obvious changes, including the presence of numerous vacuoles and electron-dense inclusions not seen in the control animals. The lesions described here are new to cephalopod pathology. Given that low-frequency noise levels in the ocean are increasing (e.g. shipping, offshore industry, and naval manoeuvres), that the role of cephalopods in marine ecosystems is only now beginning to be understood, and that reliable bioacoustic data on invertebrates are scarce, the present study and future investigations will bring an important contribution to the sustainable use of the marine environment.

Methods: A 3D bioacoustic-thermal model using the finite element method was implemented to assess multiple applicator implant configurations for thermal ablation with interstitial ultrasound energy. Interstitial applicators consist of linear arrays of up to four 10 mm-long tubular ultrasound transducers, each under separate and dynamic power control, enclosed within a water-cooled delivery catheter (2.4 mm OD). The authors considered parallel implants with two and three applicators (clustered configuration), spaced 2-3 cm apart, to simulate open surgical placement. In addition, the authors considered two applicator implants with applicators converging and diverging at angles of similar to 20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 45 degrees to simulate percutaneous placement. Heating experiments (10-15 min) were performed and compared against simulations employing the same experimental parameters. To estimate the performance of parallel, multiple applicator configurations in an in vivo setting, simulations were performed taking into account a range of blood perfusion levels (0, 5, 12, and 15 kg m(-3) s(-1)) that may occur in tumors of varying vascularity. The impact of tailoring the power supplied to individual transducer elements along the length of applicators is explored for applicators inserted in non-parallel (converging and diverging) configurations. Thermal dose (t(43) > 240 min) and temperature thresholds (T > 52 degrees C) were used to define the ablation zones, with dynamic changes to tissue acoustic and thermal properties incorporated within the model. Results: Experiments in ex vivo bovine liver yielded ablation zones ranging between 4.0-5.6 cm x 3.2-4.9 cm, in cross section. Ablation zone dimensions predicted by simulations with similar parameters to the experiments were in close agreement (within 5 mm). Simulations of in vivo heating showed that 15 min heating and interapplicator spacing less than 3 cm are required to obtain contiguous, complete ablation zones. The ability to create complete ablation zone profiles for nonparallel implants was illustrated by tailoring applied power levels along the length of applicators. Conclusions: Parallel implants consisting of three interstitial ultrasound applicators in a triangular configuration yield complete ablation zones measuring up to 6.2 cm x 5.7 cm after 15 min heating. At larger interapplicator spacing, the level of blood perfusion in the tumor may yield indentations along the periphery of the ablation zone. Tailoring applied power along the length of the applicator can accommodate for nonparallel implants, without compromising safety.

The highest diversity occurs in Ecuador (215 species), followed by Colombia (202), Peru (139), Venezuela (60), Brazil (30), Bolivia (17), Guyana (6) Suriname and French Guiana (5). The genus is divided into 11 species groups. Of these, the P. conspicillatus group (containing 34 species), distributed in extreme southeastern Costa Rica, Isla Taboga (Panama), northern South America (from Colombia to eastern Guyana), south Bolivia, and is the best represented in Brazil (16 species). The main characteristics of this group are the tympanic membrane and tympanic annulus distinct (except in P. johannesdei); dorsum smooth or shagreen; dorsal lateral fold present or absent; usually smooth belly, but may be weakly granular in some species; toe V slightly larger than the toe III. Most of the taxonomic inconsistencies in species of Pristimantis could be due to its much conserved morphology and the lack of comprehensive taxonomic evaluations. Thus, an ongoing challenge for taxonomists dealing with the Pristimantis genus is the ubiquitous abundance of cryptic species. In this context, accurate species delimitation should integrate evidences of morphological, molecular, bioacoustics and ecological data, among others. Based on an integrative taxonomy perspective, we utilize morphological, molecular (mtDNA) and bioacoustic evidence to describe four new species of the Pristimantis conspicillatus group from the eastern Amazon basin.

The taxonomy of the group has for a long time been controversial; once these species were transferred to Eupoecilimon and many new species have been described since the revision by Ramme (1933) or synonyms have been suggested/re-established. This study aims to test the classification of the group presently based on morphological characters by bioacoustic data. The following results were obtained or conclusions arrived. First, several qualitative morphological characters previously used in descriptions/diagnoses of the species are variable and overlap between species. Those are the elevation and widening of pronotum in metazona, the emargination of caudal margin of pronotal disc and the structure of male subgenital plate at caudal margin. Thus, still the male cercus, especially the orientation of denticles, is the most productive structure may allow more objective delimitation of species. As in qualitative morphology the general morphometry seems uninformative for the taxonomy of the group. Second, male calling song and partly the number of stridulatory pegs are more useful characters both for delimitation of species and describing their relationships. Especially, the pattern of the syllable, the number of impulses per syllable and the duration of early part of syllable in species group allow us a more objective delimitation of the species and definition of relationships. Third, from the distribution and relationships of species, we suggested three radiation centres for the lineage: (1) Northwest Anatolia + Eastern Balkans, (2) Northeast Anatolia + Caucasus and (3) Crimea. Fourth, after evaluating morphological and song phenotypes we considered 21 species in P. bosphoricus group constituting three subgroups: (1) P. sureyanus and P. kocaki (+ P. athos), 2) P. turcicus + P. turciae and (3) P. bidens, P. bischoffi, P. bosphoricus, P. cervus, P. demirsoyi, P. geoktschajcus, P. heinrichi, P. istanbul, P. miramae, P. pliginskii, P. proximus, P. roseoviridis sp. n., P. scythicus, P. similis and P. tauricus (+ P. djakonovi).

Natural behaviors include producing vocalizations and responding to them. If it can be shown that the natural vocal repertoire is preserved in zoos, studies in zoos may help to expand the knowledge of acoustic behaviors and transfer it to animals in the wild. Once the meaning of diverse vocalizations is known, inferences can be made about an animal's internal state in order to adapt and improve conditions for animals in zoos. In this paper, a natural and selective response of meerkats to potentially threatening acoustic signals such as the call of a predator is demonstrated. It can be shown that both the graded structure of meerkat alarm calls, which serves to convey the urgency of a dangerous situation, and the natural response to alarm calls are preserved. The obtained findings allow a continuation of the bioacoustic studies known for wild meerkats in zoos. The meerkat's ability to already recognize acoustic signals as a potential threat may be crucial information for certain husbandry conditions. Vocalizing predators kept or naturally occurring near the meerkat enclosure form one example. The level of stress induced by potential threats and the associated alertness could be determined by using the graded alarm calls as a tool. Animals living in human care for several generations face the risk of losing natural behaviors, which can lead to reduced animal welfare. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that meerkats (Suricata suricatta) living in zoos can assess potential danger and respond naturally based on acoustic signals only. This includes that the graded information of urgency in alarm calls as well as a response to those alarm calls is retained in captivity. To test the response to acoustic signals with different threat potential, meerkats were played calls of various animals differing in size and threat (e.g., robin, raven, buzzard, jackal) while their behavior was observed. The emitted alarm calls were recorded and examined for their graded structure on the one hand and played back to them on the other hand by means of a playback experiment to see whether the animals react to their own alarm calls even in the absence of danger. A fuzzy clustering algorithm was used to analyze and classify the alarm calls. Subsequently, the features that best described the graded structure were isolated using the LASSO algorithm and compared to features already known from wild meerkats. The results show that the graded structure is maintained in captivity and can be described by features such as noise and duration. The animals respond to new threats and can distinguish animal calls that are dangerous to them from those that are not, indicating the preservation of natural cooperative behavior. In addition, the playback experiments show that the meerkats respond to their own alarm calls with vigilance and escape behavior. The findings can be used to draw conclusions about the intensity of alertness in captive meerkats and to adapt husbandry conditions to appropriate welfare.",meerkats;suricates;bioacoustics;graded structure;vocalization;alarm calls;playback experiment;fuzzy clustering;LASSO algorithm;zoo;natural behavior;animal welfare;acoustic features,ANIMALS,2021,NOV,Article,English,"Agriculture, Dairy \& Animal Science;Veterinary Sciences;Zoology"

In this study, we evaluated a new acoustic ventilatory rate monitoring technology for accuracy, precision, reliability, and the ability to detect pauses in ventilation, relative to capnometry and a reference method in postsurgical patients. METHODS: Adult patients presenting to the postanesthesia care unit were connected to a Pulse CO-Oximeter with acoustic monitoring technology (Rad-87, version 7804, Masimo, Irvine, CA) through an adhesive bioacoustic sensor (RAS-125, rev C) applied to the neck. Each subject also wore a nasal cannula connected to a bedside capnometer (Capnostream20, version 4.5, Oridion, Needham, MA). The acoustic monitor and capnometer were connected to a computer for continuous acoustic and expiratory carbon dioxide waveform recordings. Recordings were retrospectively analyzed by a trained technician in a setting that allowed for the simultaneous viewing of both waveforms while listening to the breathing sounds from the acoustic signal to determine inspiration and expiration reference markers within the ventilatory cycle without using the acoustic monitor- or capnometer-calculated ventilatory rate. This allowed the automatic calculation of a reference ventilatory rate for each device through a software program (TagEditor, Masimo). Accuracy (relative to the respective reference) and precision of each device were estimated and compared with each other. Sensitivity for detection of pauses in ventilation, defined as no inspiration or expiration activity in the reference ventilatory cycle for 30 seconds, was also determined. The devices were also evaluated for their reliability, i.e., the percentage of the time when each displayed a value and did not drop a measurement. RESULTS: Thirty-three adults (73\% female) with age of 45 14 years and weight 117 +/- 42 kg were enrolled. A total of 3712 minutes of monitoring time (average 112 minutes per subject) were analyzed across the 2 devices, reference ventilatory rates ranged from 1.9 to 49.1 bpm. Acoustic monitoring showed significantly greater accuracy (P = 0.0056) and precision (P- = 0.0024) for respiratory rate as compared with capnometry. On average, both devices displayed data over 97\% of the monitored time. The (0.95, 0.95) lower tolerance limits for the acoustic monitor and capnometer were 94\% and 84\%, respectively. Acoustic monitoring was marginally more sensitive (P = 0.0461) to pauses in ventilation (81\% vs 62\%) in 21 apneic events. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of a population of postsurgical patients, the acoustic monitor and capnometer both reliably monitored ventilatory rate. The acoustic monitor was statistically more accurate and more precise than the capnometer, but differences in performance were modest. It is not known whether the observed differences are clinically significant. The acoustic monitor was more sensitive to detecting pauses in ventilation. Acoustic monitoring may provide an effective and convenient means of monitoring ventilatory rate in postsurgical patients.",,ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA,2013,JUL,Article,English,Anesthesiology

Consequently, auditory capabilities of an organism need to be evaluated and compared interspecifically. Telcost fishes provide excellent models to examine these issues due to their diversity of hearing capabilities. Broadly, fishes can be categorized as hearing specialists (broad hearing frequency range with low auditory thresholds) or healing generalists (narrower frequency range with higher auditory thresholds). The goal of this study was to examine the immediate effects of white noise exposure (0.3-2.0 kHz, 142 dB re: 1 muPa) and recovery after exposure (1-6 days) on a healing generalist fish, bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Noise exposure resulted in only a slight, but not statistically significant, elevation in auditory threshold compared to fish not exposed to noise. In combination with results from our previous studies examining effects of noise on a hearing specialist fish, the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), this study provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that fish's auditory thresholds can be differentially affected by noise exposure.

Our comparative database assembled over the past years comprises fresh material for molecular analysis from all 58 nominal Boophis species, and advertisement call recordings from all except three species. We follow an integrative approach and combine molecular, bioacoustic and morphological evidence to diagnose the new species. In most cases, the new species have uncorrected molecular divergences of over 4-5\% in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene to their closest relatives. In some cases the divergences are lower (2-2.5\%) but are then accompanied by distinct differences in advertisement calls or morphology. Boophis piperatus sp. nov. from Ranomafana National Park is a small brown species assigned to the B. majori group that is similar to B. miniatus but differs in morphology and advertisement calls. Boophis arcanus sp. nov. is assigned to the B. majori group as well and is known from only two female specimens from a site close to Ranomafana; it is described mainly based on its strong genetic differentiation (>7.2\% to all other species). Boophis entingae sp. nov. is a species of the Boophis goudoti group occurring in northern Madagascar, similar to and sympatric with B. brachychir, but with a strongly different advertisement call. Boophis roseipalmatus sp. nov. belongs to the B. goudoti group, is similar to B. madagascariensis, and appears to replace this species in most of northern Madagascar, with possible areas of sympatry in the north east. Boophis spinophis sp. nov. is an enigmatic, morphologically highly divergent species from Ranomafana National Park that belongs into the B. goudoti group but differs from all other species in the group by having distinct dermal tubercles along the lateral parts of the shank and around the elbow. Boophis praedictus sp. nov. is a sibling species of B. albilabris in the B. albilabris group, diagnosable by its red iris periphery and distributed in rainforest along the east coast. Boophis sandrae sp. nov. belongs to the B. luteus group and is superficially similar to the sympatric B. elenae, but has a faster call and smaller body size. Boophis miadana sp. nov. and B. haingana sp. nov., both in the B. albipunctatus group and syntopically occurring at Andohahela National Park, are related to B. ankaratra and B. schuboeae and differ mainly by their advertisement calls. Boophis luciae sp. nov., also in the B. albipunctatus group, differs from the sympatric B. albipunctatus and B. sibilans by having slightly smaller body size and different advertisement calls. We furthermore resurrect Rhacophorus obscurus Boettger, 1913 (as Boophis obscurus in the B. goudoti group) from the synonymy of Boophis goudoti as well as Rhacophorus andrangoloaka Ahl, 1928 (as Boophis andrangoloaka in the B. microtympanum group) from the synonymy of Boophis rhodoscelis, and propose to consider Rhacophorus brevirostris Ahl, 1928 as junior synonym of Boophis andrangoloaka. We discuss our integrative methodological approach and the different lines of evidence used to delimitate the species described or resurrected herein. By applying IUCN Redlist criteria, we evaluate the threat status of the species considered: six species are classified Data Deficient (B. arcanus, B. haingana, B. miadana, B. piperatus, B. praedictus, B. spinophis), four Vulnerable (B. andrangoloaka, B. entingae, B. roseipalmatus, B. sanrae), and two Least Concern (B. luciae, B. obscurus).",Amphibia: Anura: Mantellidae;Boophis;cryptic species;DNA barcoding;integrative taxonomy;Madagascar,ZOOTAXA,2010,FEB 26,Article,English,Zoology

We present an expanded molecular phylogeny that contains 235 terminals, 104 of which are new to this study. Notable additions to this phylogeny include seven of the 12 species in the minuta group, 15 Ranitomeya amazonica, 20 R. lamasi, two R. sirensis, 30 R. ventrimaculata and seven R. uakarii. Previous researchers have long recognized two distinct, reciprocally monophyletic species groups contained within Ranitomeya, sensu Grant et al. 2006: the ventrimaculata group, which is distributed throughout much of the Amazon, and the minuta group of the northern Andes and Central America. We restrict Ranitomeya to the former group and erect a new genus, Andinobates Twomey, Brown, Amezquita \& Mejia-Vargas gen. nov., for members of the minuta group. Other major taxonomic results of the current revision include the following: (i) A new species, Ranitomeya toraro Brown, Caldwell, Twomey, Melo-Sampaio \& Souza sp. nov., is described from western Brazil. This species has long been referred to as R. ventrimaculata but new morphological and phylogenetic data place it sister to R. defleri. (ii) Examination of the holotype of R. ventrimaculata revealed that this specimen is in fact a member of what is currently referred to as R. duellmani, therefore, Dendrobates duellmani Schulte 1999 is considered herein a junior synonym of D. ventrimaculatus Shreve 1935 (= R. ventrimaculata). (iii) For the frogs that were being called R. ventrimaculata prior to this revision, the oldest available and therefore applicable name is R. variabilis. Whereas previous definitions of R. variabilis were restricted to spotted highland frogs near Tarapoto, Peru, our data suggest that this color morph is conspecific with lowland striped counterparts. Therefore, the definition of R. variabilis is greatly expanded to include most frogs which were (prior to this revision) referred to as R. ventrimaculata. (iv) Phylogenetic and bioacoustic evidence support the retention of R. amazonica as a valid species related to R. variabilis as defined in this paper. Based on phylogenetic data, R. amazonica appears to be distributed throughout much of the lower Amazon, as far east as French Guiana and the Amazon Delta and as far west as Iquitos, Peru. (v) Behavioral and morphological data, as well as phylogenetic data which includes topotypic material of R. sirensis and numerous samples of R. lamasi, suggest that the names sirensis, lamasi and biolat are applicable to a single, widespread species that displays considerable morphological variation throughout its range. The oldest available name for this group is sirensis Aichinger; therefore, we expand the definition of R. sirensis. (vi) Ranitomeya ignea and R. intermedia, elevated to the species status in a previous revision, are placed as junior synonyms of R. reticulata and R. imitator, respectively. (vii) Ranitomeya rubrocephala is designated as nomen dubium. In addition to taxonomic changes, this revision includes the following: (i) Explicit definitions of species groups that are consistent with our proposed taxonomy. (ii) A comprehensive dichotomous key for identification of `small' aposematic poison frogs of South and Central America. (iii) Detailed distribution maps of all Ranitomeya species, including unpublished localities for most species. In some cases, these records result in substantial range extensions (e. g., R. uakarii, R. fantastica). (iv) Tadpole descriptions for R. amazonica, R. flavovittata, R. imitator, R. toraro sp. nov., R. uakarii and R. variabilis; plus a summary of tadpole morphological data for Andinobates and Ranitomeya species. (v) A summary of call data on most members of Andinobates and Ranitomeya, including call data of several species that have not been published before. (vi) A discussion on the continued impacts of the pet trade on poison frogs (vii) A discussion on several cases of potential Mullerian mimicry within the genus Ranitomeya.

A widely applied way to detect wood-boring insects is to insert a piezoelectric probe with an uncoated waveguide in the tree trunk and listen for locomotion or feeding sounds through headphones. This approach has several shortcomings: (a) frequent manual inspection of trees is costly and impractical to scale to hundreds or thousands of trees, (b) the larvae could be present but inactive during the inspection time and, (c) when the trees are in urban environments the background noise can be significant and can mask the feeble sounds of wood-boring insects even with the use of specialized headphones. We introduce a remotely controlled device that records and wirelessly transmits on a scheduled basis short recordings of the internal vibrations of a tree to a server. The user can listen remotely or process the recording automatically to infer the infestation state of the tree with wood-boring insects that feed or move inside the tree. When integrated within the IoT framework this device can scale up to automatically monitoring the trees of the entire city.

Scarcity of empirical evidence for this hypothesis may be because studies determine scale of effect for individual environmental variables; however, seasonal movement is the product of reactions to multiple variables. Objectives We predicted scale of effect should correspond to movement range for the most predictive single scale habitat model with multiple predictors ({''}overall scale of effect{''}), but not for individual predictors. Methods We used passive acoustic monitoring and machine learning to model home range and territorial (i.e., defended area) habitat for the common nighthawk. We modeled extents from 0.1 to 12.8 km to determine the overall scale of effect. We used the scale of effect for each predictor to build optimized models and evaluated their spatial predictive performance. Results The overall scale of effect was 0.2 km for territorial habitat and 1.6 km for home range habitat, which roughly equate to territory and home range size. The scale of effect for individual predictors that explained the most deviance did not correspond to overall scale of effect. Models with each predictor at its scale of effect offered no substantial improvements in predictive performance relative to overall scale of effect models. Conclusions Our new perspective on scale of effect suggests that different mechanisms drive overall scale of effect and scale of effect of individual variables.

Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae), has been shown to be pathogenic against R. ferrugineus in laboratory and field studies. However, because they remain inside the trunks until adulthood, the slowing of feeding and increases in mortality of internally feeding R. ferrugineus larvae over time after B. bassiana treatment has not been established. To explore the potential of acoustic methods to assess treatment effects, sound impulses produced by untreated, 10(4)-, and 10(6)- conidia ml(-1) B. bassiana-treated larvae in palms were recorded for 23 d, after which the palms were dissected and the larvae examined. Analyses were performed to identify trains of impulses with characteristic patterns (bursts) produced frequently by moving and feeding larvae but only rarely (3-8\% of the larval rate) by interfering background noise or tree vibrations. The rates of bursts, the counts of larval impulses per burst, and the rates of impulses in bursts decreased significantly over time in both B. bassiana treatments but not in the control. This supports a hypothesis that larvae had briefer movement and feeding bouts as they became weaker after infection, which reduced the counts of larval impulses per burst, the rates of bursts, and the rates of impulses in bursts. There is considerable potential for use of acoustic methods as tools for nondestructive assessment of effects of biological control treatments against internally feeding insect pests.",detection;entomopathogenic fungi;biological control,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,2015,APR,Article,English,Entomology

Recently, however, the biomechanical physical coupling of arm movements to speech vocalization has been studied in steady-state vocalization and monosyllabic utterances, where forces produced during gesturing are transferred onto the tensioned body, leading to changes in respiratory-related activity and thereby affecting vocalization F0 and intensity. In the current experiment (n = 37), we extend this previous line of work to show that gesture-speech physics also impacts fluent speech. Compared with nonmovement, participants who are producing fluent self-formulated speech while rhythmically moving their limbs demonstrate heightened F0 and amplitude envelope, and such effects are more pronounced for higher-impulse arm versus lower-impulse wrist movement. We replicate that acoustic peaks arise especially during moments of peak impulse (i.e., the beat) of the movement, namely around deceleration phases of the movement. Finally, higher deceleration rates of higher-mass arm movements were related to higher peaks in acoustics. These results confirm a role for physical impulses of gesture affecting the speech system. We discuss the implications of gesture-speech physics for understanding of the emergence of communicative gesture, both ontogenetically and phylogenetically.",hand gesture;speech production;speech acoustics;biomechanics;entrainment,ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,2021,MAY,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

To further understand interactions between invasive and native species in situ, competitive interactions between native logperch (Percina caprodes) and invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) were examined using submerged enclosures in the Duluth-Superior Harbour. Experiments were conducted on rocky or sandy substrate throughout the spring and summer months. Trials consisted of single fish, paired conspecifics or round goby/logperch pairs with weight change determined after 28 days. The round gobies were able to outcompete and/or negatively affect logperch on rocky substrates as a direct result of round goby/logperch interactions, as logperch fared well when round gobies were excluded from the enclosures. Although there is evidence that round gobies exclude logperch from rocky substrates, the logperch population remains close to pre-invasion levels in the predominantly soft-bottomed harbour. The continued coexistence of the logperch with the round goby is attributed to the vastly greater area of soft-bottom vs. rocky substrate in the harbour, with the round gobies in the soft bottom younger and smaller than those in the rocky substrate. Recent evidence suggests that the round goby population is declining on the soft substrates indicating that the two populations will continue to coexist in the harbour.",invasive species;lake superior;cage studies;competition,ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,2017,JAN,Article,English,Fisheries;Marine \& Freshwater Biology

However, such signals are not always available. The development of a smartphone-based respiratory sound analysis system has received increased attention. In this study, we propose an optical approach that takes advantage of a smartphone's camera and provides a chest movement signal useful for classification of the breath phases when simultaneously recording tracheal sounds. Spirometer and smartphone-based signals were acquired from N = 13 healthy volunteers breathing at different frequencies, airflow and volume levels. We found that the smartphone-acquired chest movement signal was highly correlated with reference volume (rho = 0.960 +/- 0.025, mean +/- SD). A simple linear regression on the chest signal was used to label the breath phases according to the slope between consecutive onsets. 100\% accuracy was found for the classification of the analyzed breath phases. We found that the proposed classification scheme can be used to correctly classify breath phases in more challenging breathing patterns, such as those that include non-breath events like swallowing, talking, and coughing, and alternating or irregular breathing.

Their naturally fragmented distributions across broad geographic landscapes have led to the complex array of smaller evolutionary ecosystems that present unique challenges from a conservation perspective. Comprehensive biodiversity assessments of karst habitats have revealed that these ecosystems contain an almost unparalleled level of endemism, and many site-restricted species remain undescribed, thus posing considerable challenges for effective conservation management. Small rock-dwelling species, such as geckos, may be particularly prone to such isolation. In this paper, we discuss one such genus, i.e., Hemiphyllodactylus, and explore its diversity across karst landforms in Yunnan Province, southwestern China. Based on morphological and genetic data, we describe two new species of Hemiphyllodactylus from karst habitats in Simao District and Yanshan County. A phylogenetic tree for Hemiphyllodactylus was constructed using 1 039 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene (ND2). The Simao and Yanshan specimens can be distinguished from all other congeners within their respective subclades based on uncorrected genetic pairwise distances greater than 6.3\% and 4.3\% respectively, as well as significant morphological differences. The discovery and description of these two new species brings the total number of described Hemiphyllodactylus species in China to 14 and indicates many more undescribed species from unsurveyed karst regions await discovery. Our findings suggest that karst ecosystems in Yunnan support a higher diversity of Hemiphyllodactylus than previously known.

Subjects were in sitting position and two acoustic sensors were placed on their back, on the left and right sides. LSI was determined from 1.2 to 2.4 L/s between 70 and 2000 Hz.

There was a positive linear relationship between the LSI and the airflow, with clear differences between the slope of patients (about 5 dB/L/s) and healthy subjects (about 10 dB/L/s). Furthermore, the LSI from the affected side of patients was close to the background noise level, at low airflows. As the airflow increases, the LSI from the affected side did also increase, but never reached the levels seen in healthy subjects. Moreover, the difference in LSI between healthy and paralyzed sides was higher in patients with lower FEV1 (\%).

Although these frogs are common and widely distributed, their taxonomy remains unclear. Two species are currently recognised, M. grandidieri and M. guttulatus, with another available name, Rana pigra, considered to be a synonym of M. grandidieri. However, molecular studies have suggested the presence of several cryptic species within the group. Additionally, due to the lack of prominent morphological features, allocating the available names to evolutionary lineages has proven challenging. In the present study, we take a first step towards solving these problems by using fragments of the 16S mitochondrial gene and RAG1 nuclear gene from all over the range of the subgenus to describe its genetic diversity. We also use a newly designed target enrichment laboratory protocol to sequence three mitochondrial fragments from five name-holding museum specimens (as old as 120 years) in order to determine to which lineages the existing names should be applied. The study of the 16S mitochondrial gene revealed 7 geographically separated lineages, distinct enough to be considered candidate species. Out of the five museum specimens analysed, four successfully yielded DNA sequences and could be attributed to one of the aforementioned lineages. Therefore, the name Mantidactylus grandidieri should be applied to the populations from North-Eastern Madagascar, while M. guttulatus refers to populations from inland localities along the Eastern coast of the island. On the other hand, the holotype of Rana pigra did not yield enough genetic material to allow definitive identification. While our data were not sufficient to assess the status of the four lineages distributed along the Eastern coast, the populations from North-Western Madagascar were highly distinct on both the mitochondrial and nuclear markers.

Some species show a certain song flexibility that enables them to reduce noise interferences in their communications. This vocal adjustment usually implies an increase in the minimum frequencies of songs. Since urban noise is mainly made up of low frequencies (about 2.5-3.5 kHz), song of species that sing at higher frequencies could be less susceptible to being masked by anthropogenic noise. This study explores whether such species also show any kind of adjustment to noisy environments. For this purpose, the spectral and temporal parameters (note duration, maximum and minimum frequency and diversity) of the song of the European Wren Troglodytes troglodytes were analysed in three different environments (urban, peri-urban and rural). To evaluate the impact of noise on the vocalizations, a specific acoustic descriptor of song variability was developed. Song variability increased along the urban noise gradient from rural to urban areas and the duration of notes decreased from rural to urban zones. Urban wrens developed more complex songs with higher frequencies and longer notes than their rural counterparts, whereas peri-urban birds occupied an intermediate position, although closer to urban ones in the length of notes. These changes could be associated with higher background noise levels, although other possible causes, such as the population density, could also explain them. Maximum frequencies were mostly outside the background noise range and differed among habitats, whereas lower frequencies unexpectedly did not differ among habitats. Our results suggest that differences in song parameters among species may lead to different mechanisms of vocal adjustment. Even in wrens, with high frequency vocalisation, interference with urban anthropogenic noise could show certain changes in their vocalizations.",song variability;acoustic pollution;speech interference level;urban noise gradient;vocal adjustment;Wren,ACTA ORNITHOLOGICA,2016,JUN,Article,English,Ornithology

These species include numerous endangered or range-restricted species, especially hotspots within Asia. Approximately 90\% of traded reptile species and half of traded individuals are captured from the wild.

Using nine autosomal microsatellites we successfully genotyped 177 samples, achieving the identification of 74 wolves. Genetic relatedness steeply decreased with increasing distance between sampling areas, thus suggesting that short-distance interpack migration is infrequent in this population. In addition, no individual from a central pack under intensive monitoring was sampled in the range of the surrounding packs over a 4-year period. The limited short-distance gene flow resulted in a cryptic genetic structure, which was revealed by Bayesian analysis. A different genetic cluster was found in each of the three mountain areas, and a small proportion of first-generation immigrants was detected. Overall, the present study suggests that local genetic differentiation in Italian wolves might arise from high spatial stability of packs and can be favoured by a combination of long-range dispersal, the attitude to mate between unrelated individuals and a high young mortality rate.",Canis lupus;Autosomal microsatellites;Cryptic genetic structure;Dispersal;Non-invasive genotyping,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH,2011,AUG,Article,English,Ecology;Zoology

Owing to its aggressiveness and hidden existence, it is difficult to visually determine whether a termite infestation is active and damage is occurring. Consequently, the development of a termite detection system as a critical component of termite pest control systems is necessary. A novel termite detection system was developed based on acoustic and temperature signals. The system has two capabilities: it can detect the presence of termites and estimate the population size. In this study, a support vector classification (SVc) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm were applied to recognize the termites' signals. After optimizing various input types, kernel functions and model parameters, a robust model was successfully constructed with a specific capability, i.e., a SVc model for detecting termites and ANN model for estimating the termite population. Based on the performance assessment, the proposed termite detection system can detect the presence of termites with an accuracy of 93.83\% and estimate their population with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 123.828. The results of our study indicated that the embedded models in the proposed termite detection system successfully proved the feasibility of detecting the presence of termites and simultaneously estimating the size of their population.

Our study used PAM to determine the seasonal occurrence of bottlenose dolphins and utilized individually specific signature whistles to (1) track individuals spatially and temporally, (2) assess site fidelity off Maryland (MD), USA, (3) estimate the minimum abundance of dolphins in the study area, and (4) develop a dynamic habitat-based relative abundance model applicable as a real-time dolphin relative abundance prediction tool. Acoustic recorders were deployed at two sites offshore of Ocean City, MD, and at one site in the upper Chesapeake Bay, MD. Acoustic recordings from 2016 to 2018 were analyzed for signature whistles, and re-occurrences of individual whistles were identified using a combination of machine learning and manual verification. A habitat-based density model was created using the number of signature whistles combined with environmental conditions. A total of 1518 unique signature whistles were identified offshore of Maryland and in the upper Chesapeake Bay. There were 184 re-occurrences of 142 whistles, with a mean of 135 d between re-occurrences (range = 1-681 d). These repeated detections of the same individuals occurred most frequently at the site near Ocean City, MD, indicating the highest site fidelity. Re-occurrences were recorded among all three sites, indicating movement of dolphins between the Chesapeake Bay and off the Atlantic coast of Maryland. The weekly number of individual dolphins detected off the Atlantic coast was significantly related to two environmental variables: sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentration. This habitat model could be used to predict relative dolphin abundance offshore of Maryland and inform management within the region, including in relation to offshore wind energy development and other stakeholders.",acoustic communication;bottlenose dolphins;density estimation;individual recognition;signature whistle;species distribution modeling;Tursiops truncatus;Western North Atlantic Ocean,ECOSPHERE,2021,AUG,Article,English,Ecology

Current efforts toward regeneration of these tissues include replicating the cellular microenvironment by developing biomaterials that facilitate cellular alignment. To assess the functional effectiveness of the engineered microenvironments, one essential criterion is quantification of cellular alignment. Therefore, there is a need for rapid, accurate, and adaptable methodologies to quantify cellular alignment for tissue engineering applications. To address this need, we developed an automated method, binarization-based extraction of alignment score (BEAS), to determine cell orientation distribution in a wide variety of microscopic images. This method combines a sequenced application of median and band-pass filters, locally adaptive thresholding approaches and image processing techniques. Cellular alignment score is obtained by applying a robust scoring algorithm to the orientation distribution. We validated the BEAS method by comparing the results with the existing approaches reported in literature (i.e., manual, radial fast Fourier transform-radial sum, and gradient based approaches). Validation results indicated that the BEAS method resulted in statistically comparable alignment scores with the manual method (coefficient of determination R-2=0.92).

Given the key role of calls in anurans' life history, long-and short-term adaptations are expected in species inhabiting noisy habitats. However, to disentangle such adaptations is a difficult task, incipiently addressed for Neotropical frogs. We investigated if males of a stream-breeding frog (Crossodactylus schmidti) adjust call traits according to the background noise, and if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) varies between call harmonics and along call notes. We measured sound pressure levels of calls and noise in the field and used a fine-scale acoustic analysis to describe the signal and noise structure and test for noise-related call adjustments. The multi-note harmonic call of C. schmidti greatly varied in the spectral structure, including a trend for increasing note amplitude along the call, a wide frequency bandwidth of the 2nd harmonic, a minor call frequency modulation due to a trend for increasing note frequency within the same harmonic, and a major call frequency modulation due to the variable location of the dominant harmonic along the call. Calls had significantly higher frequencies than the noise at the range of the 1st and the 2nd call harmonics, and significantly louder sound pressure than the noise at the range of all harmonics. Males emitted the majority of call notes showing positive SNR, and though males also emitted some notes with negative SNR, when a given harmonic was negative the other harmonics in the same note did not tend to be SNR-negative. Our results indicate that male C. schmidti show short-term acoustic adjustments that make the advertisement call effective for coping with the interference of the stream-generated noise. We suggest that the call spectral plasticity serves for coping with temporary changes in the background noise, whilst we also discuss the possibility that the redundant, harmonic-structured call may have evolved to diminish masking interference on the acoustic signal by the background noise. This is the first study to uncouple noise-related acoustic adjustments and putative long-term acoustic adaptations for a Hylodidae, providing insights on behavioral plasticity and signal evolution of stream-breeding frogs.",Background noise;Signal-to-noise ratio;Acoustic plasticity;Crossodacytlus;Hylodidae,ACTA ETHOLOGICA,2016,OCT,Article,English,Behavioral Sciences;Zoology

To better understand the species' behavior, it is necessary to compare visual and acoustic observations and link vocalizations to individuals and their specific actions. However, the task of linking sounds to individual dolphins is challenging for human observers because dolphins do not display specific visual cues when producing a sound, and also because human hearing is not nat-adapted to locate underwater sound sources. To respond to these challenges, a new underwater 360 degrees HD audio-video device, the BaBeL, was designed and built. This device consists of a five-hydrophone array attached to two wide-angle video cameras that together cover a 360 degrees field of vision. Acoustic recordings were analyzed with a customized program to detect and localize sound sources and to identify individual vocalizing dolphins. Data from a population of bottlenose dolphins were collected during 14 boat surveys along the northwest coast of Reunion Island (France) by following a strict pre-established protocol to standardize data collection. A total of 21 min of audio-video were recorded when dolphins were present, and 42 click trains and 42 whistles were detected from these data. Dolphins identified as vocalizers were also present for 17\% (n = 7) of emitted click trains and 33\% (n = 14) of emitted whistles on the videos. Therefore, an analysis of three video sequences as examples of the scope of this methodology is presented. The results show that when the observers stayed ahead and avoided the direct path of groups of five to nine dolphins, only one animal emitted click trains while swimming towards the observers or after turning its rostrum in the humans' direction, and this dolphin was never the one leading the group. The benefits of using this audio-video device for underwater observations of dolphins in clear water with good visibility are discussed.",behavior;acoustics;hydrophone array;acoustic localization;bottlenose dolphin;Tursiops truncatus,AQUATIC MAMMALS,2017,,Article,English,Marine \& Freshwater Biology;Zoology

Here we investigate the mode and tempo of evolution of a new endemic cricket genus, Pixibinthus, recently discovered in southern New Caledonia. First we formally describe this new monotypic genus found exclusively in the open shrubby vegetation on metalliferous soils, named `maquis minier', unique to New Caledonia. We then reconstruct a dated molecular phylogeny based on five mitochondrial and four nuclear loci in order to establish relationships of Pixibinthus within Eneopterinae crickets. Pixibinthus is recovered as thesister clade of the endemic genus Agnotecous, mostly rainforest-dwellers. Dating results show that the island colonization by their common ancestor occurred around 34.7 Myr, shortly after New Caledonia re-emergence. Pixibinthus and Agnotecous are then one of the oldest insect lineages documented so far for New Caledonia. This discovery highlights for the first time two clear-cut ecological specializations between sister clades, as Agnotecous is mainly found in rainforests with 19 species, whereas Pixibinthus is found in open habitats with a single documented species. The preference of Pixibinthus for open habitats and of Agnotecous for forest habitats nicely fits an acoustic specialization, either explained by differences in body size or in acoustic properties of their respective habitats. We hypothesize that landscape dynamics, linked to major past climatic events and recent change in fire regimes are possible causes for both present-day low diversity and rarity in genus Pixibinthus. The unique evolutionary history of this old New Caledonian lineage stresses the importance to increase our knowledge on the faunal biodiversity of `maquis minier', in order to better understand the origin and past dynamics of New Caledonian biota.",,PLOS ONE,2016,MAR 30,Article,English,Multidisciplinary Sciences

Using 40 sites to investigate diurnal and nocturnal flower visitors in small-scale agroecosystems across land-use gra-dients in Thailand and tropical South-western China, we show that habitat structure shapes pollinator com-munities at local (floral species richness) and landscape level (percentage of tree plantation in a 500 m radius and percentage forest in a 5 km radius), influencing both the species richness of pollinators and their visitation rates. These, in turn, alter plant-pollinator network structure: community-level specialization increases with floral species richness and percentage of forest cover. However, the specialization decreases with percentage of tree plantation, illustrating that natural habitat better supports specialized species. Furthermore, fruit-sets of several crops were affected by land-use. Notably, fruit-set of mango was positively associated with the percentage of forest cover in the surrounding landscape.

Currently, the analysis of USV data is performed manually, and thus is time consuming. New method: The goal of the present study was to develop a method for automated USV recognition using a `template detection' procedure for vocalizations in the 50-kHz range (35-80 kHz). The detector is designed to run within XBAT, a MATLAB graphical user interface and extensible bioacoustics tool developed at Cornell University. Results: Results show that this method is capable of detecting >90\% of emitted USVs and that time spent analyzing data by experimenters is greatly reduced. Comparison with existing methods: Currently, no viable and publicly available methods exist for the automated detection of USVs. The present method, in combination with the XBAT environment is ideal for the USV community as it allows others to (1) detect USVs within a user-friendly environment, (2) make improvements to the detector and disseminate and (3) develop new tools for analysis within the MATLAB environment. Conclusions: The present detector provides an open-source, accurate method for the detection of 50-kHz USVs. Ongoing research will extend the current method for use in the 22-kHz frequency range of ultrasonic vocalizations. Moreover, collaborative efforts among USV researchers may enhance the capabilities of the current detector via changes to the templates and the development of new programs for analysis.

The mechanisms used by individual ant workers to coordinate their building behaviour are largely unknown. We discovered that isolated workers of the Chaco leaf-cutting ant Atta vollenweideri stridulate while excavating in soil, and we investigated the possibility that workers communicate via vibrational signals in the context of collective nest excavation. Workers were observed to stridulate at similar rates, not only while manipulating soil with their mandibles, but also several seconds before grabbing the material. The measured attenuation rate suggests a detectable signal range of less than 6 cm. When presented with stridulation signals in an experimental arena offering distinct locations to excavate, workers were more likely to dig close to the source than at an alternative site. The probability of a worker digging at a location increased with the intensity of the vibrational signals produced at this location. Group-level stridulatory activity was monitored in the context of nest enlargement, in which ants excavating a tunnel were allowed suddenly to break into an existing chamber. Recordings before and after having gained access to the chamber showed that workers stridulated while excavating, but gradually discontinued signal production when nest space was available. Our results indicate that beyond the previously described use of vibrational signals in the contexts of food recruitment and alarm communication, workers stridulate while engaged in nest digging and attract nestmates to join excavation activity at the same location, thus contributing to the spatial organization of collective nest building.

The O(1 m) thick turbulence patches have vertical wavenumber spectra for microscale shear commensurate with the Nasmyth model turbulence spectrum. However, the turbulence bursts of O(10(-5) W kg(-1)) proposed to occur in such dense swarms appear to be rare. Thus far, intense turbulent bursts have been found infrequently, even in very dense aggregations O(10(4) individuals per cubic meter) characteristic of coastal and high-latitude environs. Based on sampling to date, this corresponds to a frequency of occurrence of less than 4\%, suggesting that turbulence production by the marine biosphere is not efficient.",,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY,2010,SEP,Article,English,Oceanography

The new species was collected along the Sepahua River, a small tributary of the Urubamba River (Departamento Ucayali, Peru) running west from the slopes of the Fitzcarrald Arch. Individuals were found active at night in the understory of evergreen lowland forest with high density of bamboo (Gruadua spp.). The new species is characterized by having complete and conspicuous dorsolateral folds, a slightly granular belly, a first finger slightly shorter than second, with large discs on fingers and toes (especially Fingers III and IV), a bright orange groin, and by lacking well-defined orange spots on the back of thighs and shanks. The advertisement call is composed of a single pulsed note with an average of 15 pulses/note, a pulse rate of 205 pulses/s, an average call length of 75 ms, and average fundamental and dominant frequencies of 1857 Hz and 3690 Hz, respectively. Pristimantis iiap occurs in sympatry with three other species of the group, P. buccinator (Rodriguez, 1994), P. fenestratus (Steindachner, 1864), and P. skydmainos (Flores and Rodriguez, 1997). Although only known from two close localities, we expect P. iiap to occur in similar forests along the Fitzcarrald Arch and on the eastern slopes of Cordillera Vilcabamba and Cordillera del Sira.",Alto Purus National Park;Brachycephaloidea;Fitzcarrald Arch;Guadua forest;terraranas;Urubamba River basin,ANNALS OF CARNEGIE MUSEUM,2016,FEB 10,Article,English,Paleontology;Zoology

Here we recorded bats from 30 different locations at varying altitudes (0-1,200 m) and latitudes (7-12 degrees N) using a full spectrum Pettersson M500-384 ultrasound detector. We used 2,070 pulses from 329 individual sequences of 20 bat species to standardise the echobank (catalogue of call characteristics). Discriminant function analyses (DFA) was carried out separately for the bats producing constant frequency (CF) and frequency modulated (FM) calls using frequency of maximum energy and end frequency, and shows an accuracy of 97.48\% and 96.09\% for CF and FM bats respectively. We also collated published reference calls for bat species in this region to develop a regional echobank for 42 species of echolocating bats from the Western Ghats.

The former is a medium-sized species, characterised by darkened lateral sides of the head (present in only one other congener, R. laevipes) and a unique combination of morphological, osteological, and molecular characters. The latter is a rather small species, characterised by medially undivided vomerine teeth with two large lateral diastemata, and presence of inguinal spots. Rhombophryne savaka sp. n. is the first species of the genus known from Makira Natural Park, and is reported also from Marojejy National Park and Ambolokopatrika (Betaolana Forest). Although its distribution range is relatively large compared to those of congeners, its known extent of occurrence is less than 2,000 km(2). As deforestation and habitat degradation persist as threats despite formal legal protection, we suggest an IUCN Red List status of Vulnerable for this species. Rhombophryne savaka sp. n. is possibly endemic to the Marojejy National Park, like several other Rhombophryne species, but is unusual in being found at a relatively low altitude. As such, it is likely to be at high risk of habitat loss and decreasing range, and we propose a status of Endangered for it.

,"IDENTIFYING CANADIAN TOAD (ANAXYRUS HEMIOPHRYS) HABITAT IN NORTHEASTERN ALBERTA, CANADA","Annich,NatashaC.;Bayne,ErinM.;Paszkowski,CynthiaA.",University of Alberta,"Conservation of amphibian species requires an understanding of both their aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Populations of Canadian Toads (Anaxyrus hemiophrys) may be declining in Alberta, Canada. Information on this species is scarce, particularly for the northeastern boreal ecoregion. Concerns exist that this species may be threatened by growth of the energy sector. We used a combination of passive acoustic monitoring and remotely measured landscape attributes to generate a predictive breeding-habitat model based on occurrence of calling males. We processed acoustic data collected over 4 y through human listening and automated recognition, resulting in 106 locations (21.3\% occurrence) with Canadian Toad detections. We used Logistic Regression to relate Canadian Toad occurrence to landscape characteristics. We found Canadian Toads used a high proportion of fen and open water wetlands near upland habitat. Coarser soils were associated with breeding sites and suggest that loose soils are needed for subsurface burrowing for hibernation. We found no indication that Canadian Toads avoided human disturbances, such as roads.",amphibians;anthropogenic disturbance;automated recognition;bioacoustics;Boreal Forest;occurrence;roads;wetlands,HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY,2019,AUG,Article,English,Zoology

In the North Pacific, they produce a distinctive sound known as the boing, which can be used to acoustically localize individuals. A vessel-based survey using both visual and passive acoustic monitoring was conducted during the spring of 2007 in a large (616,000 km(2)) study area encompassing the Mariana Islands. We applied line transect methods to data collected from a towed hydrophone array to estimate the abundance of calling minke whales in our study area. No minke whales were sighted, but there were hundreds of acoustic detections of boings. Computer algorithms were developed to localize calling minke whales from acoustic recordings, resulting in over 30 independent localizations, a six-fold increase over those estimated during the survey. The two best estimates of abundance of calling minke whales were determined to be 80 and 91 animals (0.13 and 0.15 animals per 1,000 km2, respectively; CV = 34\%). These are the first density and abundance estimates for calling minke whales using towed hydrophone array surveys, and the first estimates for this species in the Mariana Islands region.

Upstream solutions to prevent their impact, including their detection, are needed. Wasmannia auropunctata, an invasive ant living in vagile supercolonies, is especially hard to track and is a major threat for tropical ecosystems and local animal communities. As part of such tropical communities, crickets are sensitive to ecological conditions, easy to collect, detectable and identifiable through their species-specific calls. Here, we evaluated the use of an acoustic community of crickets as an indicator of the presence of W. auropunctata in New Caledonia. We evaluated the dominance of the crickets in the soundscape, describe the cricket community structure and diversity along a shrubland to forest gradient, characterize these cricket communities structure and diversity in the light of ongoing invasion by W. auropunctata, and identify cricket species' indicators of the invasion. Acoustic recordings collected on 24 sites were described using humanlistening and spectrographic visualization. The results demonstrated a clear dominance of the cricket group in the New Caledonian nocturnal soundscapes. Each habitat harbored a specific acoustic cricket community related to specific environmental attributes including vegetation height, daily variation of humidity and temperature. The presence of W. auropunctata was significantly associated with a lower cricket acoustic activity and species richness at night. Of the 19 species detected, four nocturnal species were identified as indicator of non-invaded forests and preforests.

Integrating different sources of data is of fundamental importance to understand the diversity of species in this group.

These circumstances have obscured the identity of this name. Moreover, the I. lactea species has had a complex taxonomic history and, in general, specimens of species in this group are poorly represented in amphibian collections. The diagnosis of the series is confusing, with many non-exclusive and variable characters barely useful. An accurate diagnosis for the series requires a precise characterization of I. lactea, its type species. Recently discovered populations, museum data, and new information on the collector of the type specimen allowed the elucidation of important issues related to this species. Here we provide the redescription of Ischnocnema lactea based on the lectotype, and intraspecific variation based on newly collected specimens. Ischnocnema lactea is characterized by its large body size (adult 19.6-26.7 mm SVL; females 27.6-34.3 mm SVL); dorsum and flanks rugose, venter granular; vocal sac single and subgular, externally expanded; finger disks expanded, T-shaped, indented and truncate in fingers II-IV; toes relative length I<II<III<V<IV;black blotch on cloacal region, tarsus, and feet; moderate calcar tubercle present.

We found significant statistical differences in spectral and temporal variables between both species; however, no acoustic trait can be considered diagnostic. Our results highlight an important topic in evolutionary biology that deserves thorough exa-mination in Andean anurans; because not all statistically significant differences in auditory signals matter in male recognition and speciation.

External morphology and song amongst Pacific island Acrocephalus warblers were investigated and comparisons made with Acrocephalus species elsewhere. There was a range of sizes between Pacific island Acrocephalus warblers, many being larger than migratory continental species. Bill:wing length ratios were higher in most Pacific species, and their wings more rounded, than most continental species, but less rounded than swamp-warblers of Africa and adjacent islands. Plumages of W and N Pacific species resembled reed-warblers elsewhere, but in SE Polynesia were more varied, brown or grey dorsally, shaded olive, yellow or rufous, and pale ventrally, shaded white, yellow or buff-white, with a melanistic morph on Tahiti. Spectrographic analysis showed a gradient of song complexity from continental and Marianas/Micronesia species (A. hiwae, A. syrinx), through to A. taiti and A. vaughani on the Pitcairn islands, which had no song.

Numerous hypotheses have been proposed in the past two centuries to explain LDG, but rigorous tests of the drivers of LDGs have been limited by a lack of high-quality global species richness data. Here we produce a high-resolution (0.025 degrees x 0.025 degrees) map of local tree species richness using a global forest inventory database with individual tree information and local biophysical characteristics from similar to 1.3 million sample plots. We then quantify drivers of local tree species richness patterns across latitudes. Generally, annual mean temperature was a dominant predictor of tree species richness, which is most consistent with the metabolic theory of biodiversity (MTB). However, MTB underestimated LDG in the tropics, where high species richness was also moderated by topographic, soil and anthropogenic factors operating at local scales. Given that local landscape variables operate synergistically with bioclimatic factors in shaping the global LDG pattern, we suggest that MTB be extended to account for co-limitation by subordinate drivers.",,NATURE ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION,2022,OCT,Article,English,Ecology;Evolutionary Biology
